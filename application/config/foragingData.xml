      <field name="title">Amaranth</field>
      <field name="slug">amaranth</field>


      <field name="group">Family: Amaranthaceae, the amaranth family</field>
      <field name="plantType"/>
      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">The leaves are good in the summer (usually best early on) and the seeds ripen in autumn, the greatest harvest being in mid-fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="habitat">Amaranth grows in fields, disturbed habitats, roadsides, and cultivated areas throughout North America.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="range">Various species grow throughout the continental US and Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">It's also native to Mexico and Europe. The seeds are so small, a muddy-footed migrating bird blown of course by a storm could have transported it across the Atlantic either way in prehistoric times.</field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a coarse-looking plant with oval to lance-shaped, long-stalked, medium-sized alternate leaves. Large, dense, coarse clusters of tiny green flower masses are present in mid- to late summer, and similar clusters of seeds in the fall.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This group of nearly 40 weedy looking, leafy plants, two to eight feet tall, bears large, distinct, dense, upright spikes of tiny seeds. There's no strong, distinct odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coarse, oval to lance-shaped, long-stalked, alternate, toothless leaves grow from one to two inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thousands of tiny, green, inconspicuous flowers, surrounded by hair-like bracts, create conspicuous, dense masses in the summer. Then thousands of tiny, round, black seeds, also in dense clusters, and surrounded by the papery bracts, cram into the same locations in autumn. </field>
      <field name="positiveId"></field>
      <field name="harvesting">Simply strip off the leaves from young plants. A few pieces of tender leaf stalks and stems are alright to include.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To harvest the seeds, look for amaranth where it's very abundant. Clip off large numbers of seed clusters with garden or kitchen shears, or a pocket knife. Put them in paper supermarket shopping bags and let them dry out a few weeks (you can store them indefinitely that way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="cooking">I find the leaves are unpleasantly bitter raw, but some people do eat them. Serve them to a raw food enthusiast you don't like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, they're excellent cooked, a little like spinach with overtones of string beans. Add them to soups, stews, sauces (especially tomato sauce), or vegetable dishes. They're also great sautéed or steamed, and strong-tasting enough that you can stir in your favorite spices or sauce in the end, or just serve with salt and pepper and a dash of olive or sesame oil. They cook in about 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rub the dry seed heads (this works with fresh seed heads too, but it's much less efficient) over a bowl to remove the seeds. Transfer to a tray or cookie sheet and blow a fan across the tray over the sink, or outdoors, to get rid of the chaff  (Note: The author and app developer disavow all responsibility for any and all housecleaning bills incurred if the chaff makes a mess in your kitchen). Use the seeds immediately, or store indefinitely in tightly closed jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not technically a grain, you can cook the nutty flavored seeds as you would a grain: Boil them in water to cover for about 15 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the seeds are soft, like rice. You may use soy, nut, or oat milk instead of water, plus fresh or dried fruit, sweet herbs (i.e., mint, cinnamon, ginger), and a sweetener, to make a sweet hot cereal. To make them more nutty tasting, toast the seeds in a pan over medium until they pop, stirring very often, before adding the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amaranth seeds are also an excellent included in grain dishes, upping the flavor and nutrition as part of a rice pilaf or stuffing. Try using 4 parts oats and 1 part toasted amaranth in your favorite oatmeal recipe, cooked along with raisins and fresh fruit.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Amaranth seeds provide vitamin A, K, B2, B6, C, and folate, as well as palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids, plus the minerals calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, copper, and manganese. They also provide a great amount of a more complete protein than that in of the true grains.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">The leaves are astringent. An infusion has been used as a gargle for hoarseness, as well as for diarrhea, excessive menstruation, and intestinal bleeding.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">Don't harvest amaranth if Hernándo Cortés is watching. He made amaranth illegal when he conquered the Aztec Indians, objecting to its use in human sacrifice (while in his native Spain, the Inquisition was burning people at the stake for religious crimes such as being Jewish), and incidentally weakening them through starvation, so he could steal their gold. The punishment for possession of this controlled substance was death!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don't eat the leaves if you have kidney problems. Like spinach, amaranth leaves contain oxalic acid (in quantities harmless to healthy people).</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Because this is a large group of species, a number of other plants resemble them enough to cause confusion when they're all young, so you should wait until you see the distinctive large, dense seed spikes before harvesting amaranth for first time. You can always return for the leaves the following year, much easier to do if you're still alive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lamb's-quarters, also edible, is probably the most similar-looking plant, but it's leaves are diamond-shaped and toothed, and its seed spikes are comparatively sparse. Both plants are sometimes called pigweed, a confusing name better avoided!</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Black nightshade leaves are poisonous raw, and they get some people sick cooked too. The medium-sized leaves are downy or smooth, oval to heart-shaped, and deep green with wavy or coarsely toothed edges, not rough and coarse like amaranth's, but  similar enough to confuse beginners. But the flowers are completely different, and the fruit is a berry, so once either species flowers or goes to seed, you can easily tell the plants apart.</field>

Because of its use in ritual human sacrifice, and because eradicating a major food source made his conquest of Mexico easier, he'd have you executed if he caught you with it. It's a very tasty wild food, but not worth losing your head over!</field>

      <field name="slug">chicory</field>


      <field name="group">Family &lt;i&gt;Asteraceae  (Compositae)&lt;/i&gt;, the astor or composite family</field>
      <field name="plantType"/>
      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">Leaves: Early spring and late fall, plus winter if mild&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flowers: Late spring to early fall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taproot (for making coffee): Early spring to late fall (and winter in mild climates)</field>
      <field name="habitat">Chicory needs full sunlight and well-drained soil, and thrives in disturbed habitats, roadsides, fields, and parks.</field>
      <field name="range">Throughout most of the continental US and Canada</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Europe</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">In cold-weather seasons, look for basal rosettes of jagged, dandelion-like leaves with teeth pointing outward, and reddish midribs. In the summer, look for nearly leafless stems around four feet tall, with showy, sky-blue composite flowers consisting of fringed ray flowers and no disk flowers.</field>


      <field name="harvesting">Collect the leaves of the smallest basal rosettes before the teeth get large and the leaves become too bitter to be palatable, in very early spring, and again when new growth appears in late fall. Pass a sharp knife under the rosette to sever it from the taproot—much more efficient that picking off the leaves a few at a time. Shake off the rosette to get rid of as much debris as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also dig up the root for making coffee any time of year with a shovel—much easier than using a trowel. Do so after it's rained, when the soil is more yielding, and choose a location that isn't rocky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't find the flowers particularly tasty, although some people do eat them.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Chicory leaves have a robust, dandelion-lettuce flavor, with a hint of bitterness that must be managed wisely. Use the leaves like dandelion leaves. Add the young leaves sparingly to salads or sandwiches. Too many may create too much bitterness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or sautée them in olive (or other) oil with herbs and spices, then add a sauce consistent with a culinary tradition that uses the same spices (i.e., Mexican spices + salsa) and simmer. Leaves shrink when you sautée them, concentrating the bitterness, but this method counteracts that tendency. Adding the sautéed greens to soups or stews, i.e., ones containing beans or noodles, [-also] works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roots are usually too tough and woody to eat (although you can still cook them, after which they'll taste like cooked wood!), but you can chop them, then roast at 350 degrees for an hour or until blackened, stirring occasionally, chop further to the size of coffee in a blender or coffee or spice grinder, and brew into a well-known caffeine-free coffee substitute. This works, although I prefer the seeds of the Kentucky coffee-tree, which makes a better wild coffee substitute.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">The leaves are an excellent source of calcium, and they also provide some potassium, phosphorus, copper, zinc, magnesium, and vitamins A, K, C, E, plus some B-complex vitamins.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Like its relative, the dandelion, which has superseded it in modern herbal practice, a decoction of the root has been used for various liver problems, and to aid digestion.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions"></field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Commercial chicory, which doesn't grow wild in the US, is actually a different species, &lt;i&gt;C. endivia&lt;/i&gt;, also called curly endive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they're very young, dandelion rosettes, also edible, resemble chicory rosettes, but dandelions' basal leaves' teeth always point toward the leaf's base. Some of chicory's leaves' teeth point outward. Chicory's basal leaves' midribs are often tinged reddish, with some fine hairs, qualities dandelions lack. Many chicory rosettes have remnants of the previous year's woody flower stalks, which dandelions also lack. And when they flower, the dandelion remains a basal rosette and produces its familiar yellow flowers, while chicory grows a tall stem with many blue flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young wild lettuce rosettes resemble chicory rosettes, but wild lettuce has fibrous roots, never a taproot, and it's midrib is triangular in cross-section. Later on, its flowers are yellow, like dandelions'.</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">This is a delicious root vegetable, prized in east Asia, with the bonus of an edible immature stem, which is prized in Italy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This coarse-looking biennial has huge, wedge-shaped leaves up to two feet long and one foot broad, forming a basal rosette the first year and at the beginning of the second year. Unlike similar plants, the leaves are whitish and finely wooly underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purplish-green leafstalks can grow up to 1.5 feet long and .75 inch thick. Common burdock's leaf stalks are hollow, not furrowed. Greater burdock's leaf stalks are solid, with a groove along the upper surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long, deep, stout taproot, whitish after being scrubbed, consists of an outer rind and inner core. It can grow up to four feet long and three inches wide, and smells like potatoes and dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The erect stem, which arises from the center of the basal rosette in mid-spring of the second year, grows from two to five feet tall in common burdock and up to nine feet tall in greater burdock. Its alternate leaves are similar to the basal leaves, but smaller, especially toward the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arising from green bases, the bristly, purple-pink, spherical, composite flowers, short-stemmed and 0.75 inch across in common burdock, long-stemmed and one to 1.5 inches across in greater burdock, resemble shaving brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ripe fruits, the inspiration for Velcro, consist of spherical burrs the size of the flowers, covered with tiny hooks.

Moist soil, from a period when there's been plenty of rain, not when it hasn't rained for weeks and the soil is rock hard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place the shovel an inch from the center of the rosette. Aim straight down, so you don't cut through the root. Grip the handle firmly with both hands. Repeatedly stomp on the shovel as hard as you can, to drive it all the way into the earth. Now, you can chance pushing upward with the shovel while gently pulling the leaves, and you may unearth the root, or most of the root, with no further effort. If it's unyielding, don't yank off the leaves, but remove the clod of soil with the shovel and repeat the process on the other side of the plant. When you're done, refill the hole with soil, so you'll create no environmental impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut off the stem with a pocket knife or pruning shears soon after it appears in mid-spring, when it's large, but still very soft and flexible, long before the flowers appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut off the leafstalks with a pocket knife any time during the growing season, but only use greater burdock. There's not enough food in common burdock's leafstalks to make it worthwhile.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The taproot tastes like a combination of potatoes and artichokes. Scrub it with a metal scouring pad under running water to clean it. Slice diagonally, razor thin, or use the finest slicing blade of a food processor, so the root becomes tender more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some foraging writers who don't cook suggest peeling the root, because the Japanese do so. But that's only because they prefer the whiter color of core to the darker one of the rind, which is just as tasty as the core. Digging up burdock takes quite a bit of effort, so you're not going to want to throw out half your harvest unnecessarily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burdock root is best simmered or steamed 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender, i.e., in soups, stews or casseroles. You can sauté it first if desired, but cooking it in liquid is necessary to tenderize it. You can also bake it in a covered baking dish that includes at least a little liquid, so the hot steam tenderizes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not poisonous raw, it's hard to digest, and members of traditional cultures cooked it, even in the days where going out to gather firewood could be dangerous because, over the years, they determined that it had the best food value cooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peel the fibers from the stems and flower stalks. This can stain your hands brown, so you may want to wear rubber gloves. Slice, then parboil 1 minute to remove the bitterness. Add it in any vegetable dish and 5 to 15 more minutes. It tastes like artichoke hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leaves are so bitter, if you squeeze one and touch your finger to your tongue, you'll wish you hadn't! Some people boil the very young leaves in multiple changes of water to get rid of the bitterness, but there are so many superior wild greens, you'd make much better use of your time and effort by learning them!</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Burdock root provides vitamins B6 and C, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, manganese, and sodium. It's an excellent source of inulin, a polysaccharide that doesn't get absorbed or elicit an insulin response, and is beneficial to people with blood sugar problems.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">A decoction made by boiling the root has been used for centuries in Europe and Asia as a blood purifier (detoxifier in modern parlance), and for the skin, liver, and kidneys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A poultice made by mixing the chopped leaves with clay and water, and bandaged to bruises, clears the the bruises in a few days. Mixing them with spearmint stems and clay may make this even more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burn care workers have reputedly had success applying the leaves topically to inhibit bacterial growth, speed healing time, and ease the changing of dressings.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">Don't eat the seeds, which may be poisonous (and they're too hard to eat anyway). And the burrs may actually be fatal—by the time you remove all the itchy fragments from your clothing, you could die of old age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don't eat the leaves if you're an African gray parrot—they'll get stuck in your digestive tract and kill you.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">"Dock" means deduct or remove, and unrelated plants that people remove from their gardens, such as the unrelated curly dock, a.k.a. yellow dock (&lt;i&gt;Rumex crispus&lt;/i&gt;), which has edible leaves and stems, have the same confusing last name. But curly dock has narrow leaves, not white underneath, with curled edges, a hard, yellow taproot, and different flowers and seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curly dock's relative bitter dock or broadleaf dock (&lt;i&gt;R. obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt;) has large leaves that do resemble burdock's, and the plants sometimes grow side-by-side, but as a relative of yellow dock, bitter dock's hard, inedible taproot is bright yellow when scraped, and again the leaves don't have burdock's white, whooly fuzz underneath. Although nonpoisonous, all parts of this plant usually taste so bad that eating them will make you wish you were dead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cardoon (&lt;i&gt;Cynara cardunculus&lt;/i&gt;) is an edible European relative of burdock that doesn't grow wild in the US. Italians in the US use the peeled, parboiled immature stem of burdock in the spring the same way cardoons are used in Italy, and, because they don't know burdock's correct English name, they incorrectly call it cardoon too, creating both confusion and some delicious recipes.</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Cocklebur (&lt;i&gt;Xanthium spp.&lt;/i&gt;) has burrs too, but they're arranged spirally, the rest of the plant doesn't look like burdock, you don't eat burdock when it has burrs, and I doubt anyone has ever been poisoned confusing the two, but you should be aware of the possibility of confusion.</field>

      <field name="season">Chickweed is in season all year, even growing in the winter any time it's above freezing, but it's at its best in early spring and mid- to late fall.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="habitat">Chickweed grows in lawns, meadows, gardens, and disturbed areas, in full sunlight and partial shade. In very cold weather, look for it along sun-heated walls with southern exposure, where it thrives in the milder microhabitat.</field>
      <field name="range">Various chickweed species grow throughout North America</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Europe</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for mats of slender-stemmed, small plants with opposite leaves and star-like, white flowers. Chickweed grows where there's at least some sun, even during the colder seasons when few other greens are around.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This small, sprawling annual's slender stem bears a distinctive row of fine white hairs, and tiny, smooth-edged, spade-shaped to oval, opposite leaves. Unlike some other ground-hugging plants, it never forms a basal rosette. Common chickweed's leaves have short leaf stalks, while star chickweed has stalkless leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiny, white flowers grow at the tips of the plants, with five petals so deeply split that they look like ten. Five green sepals surround the petals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiny yellow-brown, oval-shaped seeds fall out of tiny ovate, stalked capsules before the plant dies.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Mats of slender-stemmed plants growing close to the ground&lt;br /&gt;•A thin line of tiny, white hairs along the stem&lt;br /&gt;•Tiny, opposite, toothless leaves&lt;br /&gt;•No colored sap&lt;br /&gt;•Tiny white flowers&lt;br /&gt;•Five white petals each split into a "V"-shape that makes them look like ten petals&lt;br /&gt;•Five green sepals</field>

      <field name="cooking">The whole plant, except the roots, is delicious—raw it tastes like corn-on-the-cob, or like cornsilk, cooked it's more like spinach. Always chop the entire plant, except the roots, into bite-sized pieces before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A salad vegetable and potherb par excellence, it's also great in sandwiches, used like sprouts or in mid-Eastern recipes, with hummus in pita bread. It's wonderful steamed, or added to soups, stews, and casseroles. You can also sautée it. It cooks in about 5 minutes, be careful not to overcook.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Chickweed is a nutritional powerhouse, providing vitamins C, A, D,  folic acid, riboflavin, niacin, and thiamine, as well as the minerals calcium, magnesium, potassium, manganese, zinc, iron, phosphorus, sodium, copper, silica.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Chickweed been applied topically to various skin sores and irritations for hundreds of years (you'd think after all that time, the sores would finally heal!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the day, while doctors were bleeding their patients, sometimes to death, herbalists gave chickweed to convalescents after serious illnesses to rebuild their strength before opportunistic infections could cause a relapse. Turns out chickweed is loaded with more vitamins and minerals than a health food store, so it probably replaced the nutrients the immune system needs, which had been depleted during the illness.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="similarPlants">Other less common species of chickweed, also edible, grow throughout the North America. Mouse-ear chickweed (&lt;i&gt;Cerastium vulgatum&lt;/i&gt;), also with opposite leaves, is hairy all over. It's good cooked, but you won't enjoy it raw unless you like eating hairy food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doorweed (&lt;i&gt;Polygonum aviculture&lt;/i&gt;) looks a little like chickweed because it grows along the ground, sometimes along with chickweed, but its leaves are alternate, not opposite. Unlike chickweed, it grows in a basal rosette. And  there's no row of hair on the stems. Instead, the stems are punctuated by joints. The plant isn't poisonous, but with the texture of string, it's not edible.</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Prostrate spurge (&lt;i&gt;Euphorbia supina&lt;/i&gt;) and spotted spurge (&lt;i&gt;E. maculata&lt;/i&gt;), which grow close to the ground and have opposite leaves, look a little like chickweed, and they can grow side-by-side with chickweed. But spurge exudes an acrid, white, milky sap when cut. Chickweed doesn't. Spurge lacks chickweed's row of tiny white hairs growing along the stem, and it grows in rosettes rather than forming mats. Spurge, which contains diterpene esters, causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea when eaten, or redness, swelling, blisters after contact with the skin and exposure to sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlet pimpernel (&lt;i&gt;Anagallis arvensis&lt;/i&gt;) is a small plant with opposite leaves that grows along the ground, but it lacks chickweed's row of fine hairs on the stem, and it has a scarlet flower.

      <field name="season">The leaves are only edible when they first come up, in early spring, although a few young leaves you can eat still grow in the center of the basal rosettes well into summer. The seed capsules are edible from late spring through mid-summer, and the seeds themselves, if you can gather enough to make your effort worthwhile, ripen in late summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the leaves medicinally spring, summer, and fall.</field>
      <field name="habitat">This plant grows in sunny areas, partial shade, cultivated areas, lawns, meadows, parks, gardens, and fields, and on bare ground.</field>

Their ribbed appearance, created by parallel veins, makes them easy to recognize, as do the short, flattened, purple leaf stalks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green, inconspicuous, wind-pollinated, pencil-shaped, leafless flower spike, with protruding white stamens, grows six to eight inches tall, and blooms in the summer and fall.

      <field name="cooking">This is one of the worst edible plants to use for food. Although you could eat the young leaves when they first appear in early spring, they're rather tough, and taste like wheat grass juice—a flavor few people love. The smaller leaves toward the center of the rosette that you can collect later on aren't any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've coated the leaves with olive oil, miso, and spices, and roasted them in a hot oven, as people sometimes do with kale, turning them often to prevent burning. They sometimes taste good this way, but other times there's an unpleasant, bitter aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green, immature fruits taste like inferior peanuts—edible, not worth the trouble. And the seeds inside the mature fruits, which you can use to thicken drinks, the way people use related psyllium seeds and flax seeds, are so tiny, it's only on rare occasions where you'll find enough to be worth gathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's only one really good thing I can say about using common plantain as food. It's not quite as bad as its relative, long-leaf plantain!</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Common plantain contains vitamins C and K, plus the minerals calcium, potassium, and sulfur, as well as trace minerals. The seeds are a good source of vitamin B1.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">In contrast to its low value as food, this is one of the best herbs for skin irritations, and it's been used as such since prehistoric times. Mash some leaves until they produce juice (some people chew them) and repeatedly apply this to a mosquito bite right after you've been bitten. It will cure the bite in about 15 minutes if used promptly. It lessens the effects of bee stings, it's good for scrapes, cooking burns, cuts, and poison ivy rash, with anti-inflammatory substances and chemicals that stop bleeding. It also contains allantoin, which promotes cell proliferation and healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tea of the mucilagenous seeds acts as a bulk laxative, good for constipation, and to for relieving intestinal irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="season">The greatest number of tender, young leaves come up very early in the spring, although a few continue to grow in the center of the rosette through late fall.</field>
      <field name="habitat">This plant grows in sunny areas, partial shade, cultivated areas, lawns, meadows, parks, gardens, and fields, and on bare ground.</field>
      <field name="range">This European plants grows across the US and Canada, and virtually worldwide.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Europe</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for basal rosettes of lance-shaped, ribbed leaves and a smooth, slender, unbranched stem topped with a small, inconspicuous, pineapple-shaped flower, growing in great quantity on lawns and in sunny, grassy, and disturbed areas.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This common herb has minimal value as food, but it's important medicinally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lance-shaped leaves, which grow six to 12 inches long, form basal rosettes exclusively. Their ribbed appearance, created by three or five parallel veins, makes them easy to recognize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A smooth, slender, unbranched stem growing less than one foot high supports a small, inconspicuous, cylindrical to pineapple-shaped brownish flower, with protruding white stamens. It blooms from late spring to early fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roots are fibrous.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Pull off the leaves or flowers with your fingers, or sever the rosette from the roots with a pocketknife.</field>
      <field name="cooking">This is one of the worst edible plants to use for food. Although you could eat the young leaves when they first appear in early spring, they're rather tough, and taste like wheat grass juice—a flavor few people favor. And the smaller leaves toward the center of the rosette are just as bad later on! Roasting the leaves, like I've done with its relative, common plantain, doesn't work with this species, and the seeds are way too small to use.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Long-leaf plantain probably has the same nutrients as its relative, common plantain: vitamins C and K, plus calcium, potassium, and sulfur, as well as trace minerals.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Not a good food, this is an excellent plant for skin irritations. Mash some leaves until they produce juice (some people chew them) and repeatedly apply this to a mosquito bite right after you've been bitten. It will cure the bite in about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lessens the effects of bee stings, it's good for scrapes, cooking burns, cuts, and poison ivy rash, with anti-inflammatory substances and chemicals that stop bleeding. It also contains allantoin, which promotes cell proliferation and healing.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">This plant, which arises from a long, slender taproot, can creep along the ground or grow upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crinkled, rounded to heart-shaped, toothed, slightly hairy, long-stalked basal leaves, and the similar alternate leaves on the main stem, grow from 0.75 to 2.5 inches across, with five to seven shallow lobes. The leaf stalks can grow as long as seven inches and the leaf is notched where it connects to the leaf stalk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White to pale-pink or lavender, the five-petaled, long-stalked flowers arise from the leaf axils.  Each flower, under 0.75 inches across, has five petals, with a bushy column of many stamens and one pistil in the center. Pink lines run the length of the petals, which are notched at the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0.25 inch across, the flattened, rounded, stalked, segmented fruit is called a cheese because it resembles a tiny wheel of cheese.</field>

      <field name="cooking">The chewy leaves, flowers, and fruits, which cook in about 10 minutes, impart a pleasant, mild flavor to salads, stews, grain dishes, and casseroles—especially good complimenting more flavorful ingredients. Like okra, this mucilaginous vegetable will thicken soups slightly. They're also fine raw, in salads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids love devouring the cheeses right off the plants as quickly as they can find them, and I enjoy the cheeses so much, I eat them at every opportunity, even though I'm a vegan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have tried boiling the roots to obtain a thickener, and cooked to eat, as with the much larger relative, the marsh mallow, but they're way to small and fibrous to be worthwhile.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Common mallow's a good source of vitamin C, iron, calcium, copper, and trace minerals.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Like its larger relative, the marsh mallow, tea made by boiling the roots is externally and internally soothing. It's supposed to be good for skin sores, stomach and duodenal ulcers, digestive tract irritations, and urinary tract irritations or cystitis, as well as sore throats, irritated air passages, coughs, and bronchitis, and has been used as such for centuries but never been subject to vigorous testing, so its effectiveness is still not confirmed.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="nutrition">Curly dock is a great source of vitamin A and iron (herbalists prescribed it for anemia back in the day, and if the anemia was caused by iron deficiency, it worked), and a good source of vitamins B1, B2, B3, and C, as well as the minerals potassium, calcium, manganese, and phosphorus.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Curly dock has been used as a blood purifier or detoxifier, especially useful for skin conditions, glandular inflammations, and swellings, for centuries. It contains rumicin, a liver decongestant that stimulates the liver to produce bile, which research has shown helps the body expel heavy metals. A decoction has been used as a bitter tonic for the stomach, where another active ingredient, emodin, stimulates peristalsis, helping with constipation, although large overdoses may cause  nausea or diarrhea. It has even been shown to slow the growth of cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The root's tannin content makes it astringent, and it's been used externally to stop the bleeding, most famously when Dr. Crusher spotted it growing on another planet, and had Capt. Picard apply the yellow taproot to stop her wound from bleeding, in an episode of "Star Trek—The Next Generation."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains anthraquinones, good for ringworm and other fungal skin infections. In England, they rub the crushed leaves on cure nettle stings, while reciting: “Nettles in, dock out,” and the herb if not the rhyme, works.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">0</field>
      <field name="cautions">The very youngest curly dock leaves, when they've just emerged from the ground and are no more than 2 or 3 inches long, can sometimes temporarily make your tongue numb if you eat them raw, perhaps from a concentration of oxalic acid crystals. Light cooking eliminates this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And never confuse curly dock with Moe dock or Larry dock (Nyuk! Nyuk! Nyuk!)</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">"Dock" means deduct or remove, and unrelated plants that people remove from their gardens, such as burdock &lt;i&gt;(Arctium spp.&lt;/i&gt;), have the same confusing last name. Burdock, with a whitish, not yellow, edible root, and an edible immature flower stalk, has broad leaves without wavy margins that are finely whitish and wooly underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the related bitter dock or broadleaf dock (&lt;i&gt;Rumex obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt;) has large leaves that do resemble curly dock's, and the plants sometimes grow side-by-side, but bitter dock has broader leaves without wavy margins. Although nonpoisonous, all parts of this plant usually taste so bad, they remind me of school lunch!</field>

      <field name="season">The youngest leaves are good to eat in early spring, when they first appear, and in late fall, when new leaves emerge. The crowns and flower buds appear in early spring too, soon after the young leaves. The plants all flowers later in early spring, when the flowers are at their best, although some continue to bloom in the summer and fall. The taproot is in season spring, summer, and fall—also in winter where winters are very mild and there are enough leaves left to locate it.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Lawns, roadsides, meadows, cultivated areas, disturbed habitats.</field>

      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Europe</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a basal rosette of hairless leaves with downward-pointing (toward the leaf base), large, jagged teeth, a slender, hairless, leafless, unbranched flower stalk, a yellow composite flower with ray flowers but no disk flowers, and a fluffy, white, spherical seed head with tiny brown seeds.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">One of the best-known wild edibles and most hated lawn weeds, everyone recognizes the flowers, but getting the youngest, tasty leaves when they're tasty, before the flowers appear takes a bit of attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jagged leaves grow from three to 12 inches long and 0.5 to 2.5 inches wide, always growing in a basal rosette. The leaves' large teeth always point toward the leaf base, not outward or toward the leaf tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cluster of short, stubby, green, flattened, rounded flower buds form in the middle of the basal rosette before the individual, smooth, green, slender flower stalks lift each bud individually two to 18 inches above the ground. The yellow composite flowers, one to two inches wide, consist of ray flowers only. Reflexed green bracts bend under each flower. The flower heads change into the familiar, white, spherical seed heads overnight. A tiny, white parachute connects to each tiny, brown seed, which is shaped like a sunflower seed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thick, brittle, beige, branching, perennial taproot grows up to ten inches long. All parts of this hairless plant exude a white milky sap when broken.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Basal rosette of leaves with large teeth pointing toward the leaf base&lt;br /&gt;•Cluster of flattened, rounded, green flower buds at ground level at first&lt;br /&gt;•Familiar yellow composite flowers, each on one hollow, hairless flower stalk&lt;br /&gt;•Spherical cluster of white parachutes attached to tiny, brown seeds&lt;br /&gt;•A white, milky latex anywhere the plant is cut&lt;br /&gt;•No hairs on any part of the plant, and no leaves other than basal leaves</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Collect only the smaller, youngest leaves, when they first come up in early spring and late fall. They become increasingly bitter soon after they appear, especially by the time they flower, and through the rest of the growing season. The bitter leaves aren't harmful, they're just way inferior to the youngest ones. Look around before harvesting, and choose plants with the broadest leaves, which are the best, not the ones where most of the leaves consist mostly of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you can certainly grab handfuls of leaves, cutting the root just under the center of the rosette with a pocketknife gets you the entire rosette in an instant, and while it's still intact, you can shake off most of the soil and debris before bagging the plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A serrated grapefruit spoon is even better than a pocket knife for cutting and scooping out the very young cluster of flower buds while they're at ground level, in the center of the rosettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collect the flowers by hand, and be sure to choose the most brightly colored ones. These are the freshest, tastiest ones, especially abundant during the peak of the flowering period, toward the end of early spring. Use a knife to remove the bitter, green sepals, in the field, or at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most roots, a shovel is the second best implement for digging them up. (The very best implement is a kid—kids love digging, and you won't have to lift a finger before you have a bagful of roots!) Since dandelions are so common, you can be picky about where you're going to dig them up Choose relatively rock-free soil, and dig after periods when rain, when digging is the easiest. </field>
      <field name="cooking">Add the youngest leaves, or their white bases alone, called "crowns," or the flowers (without their bitter sepals) raw to salads. They're quite tasty, strongly flavored with an overtone of bitterness. If the slight bitterness bothers you, use them sparingly, include strong-flavored ingredients, such as wild onions (&lt;i&gt;Allium spp.&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sautéeing dandelion leaves or crowns shrinks them and concentrates this bitterness, but it miraculously vanishes if you cook them further in a sauce, especially if you include spices. I sautée them 10 minutes, then simmer another 10 minutes, using a cooking oil, spices, and sauce that come from the same culinary tradition. You can make a side dish this way, or include pasta, grain, bread cubes, or other sources of protein to make a dandelion-based entrée.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can sautée the flower buds, or after removing the sepals, the flowers too. They taste somewhat like carrots, so sautéeing the two vegetables together in olive oil, seasoned with mint and marjoram, plus a dash of white wine plus salt and pepper to taste, works especially well, and the carrots' sweetness offsets the flowers' slight bitterness. Or stir the flowers into pancake batter and cook on a griddle like you'd cook pancakes, to make dandelion fritters. The flowers are also famous for making dandelion wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people cook and eat the taproots. I've found them too bitter and fibrous—way inferior to other wild root vegetables. Conceivably, they youngest taproots might be better, but since the dandelion's a perennial, there's no way to determine in advance which taproots are the youngest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have also roasted the taproots until black, ground them, and used them for making coffee. As someone who doesn't like coffee, I've never tried it myself.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">The leaves have more beta-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A, than carrots, and more iron and calcium than spinach. They also provide vitamins B1, B2, B5, B6, B12, C, E, P, and D, plus biotin, inositol, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and zinc. The flowers provides beta carotene tool. Oh, and, if I didn't already mention it, eating dandelion leaves is good for you!</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">People have been drinking a decoction of dandelion roots, made by boiling 1 tbs. of the chopped root in 1 cup of water, as a tonic, since prehistoric times. It contains inulin, a polysaccharide that doesn't elicit an insulin response—good for diabetics and hypoglycemics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the glycoside taraxacin, it's especially good for the liver and gallbladder, where it promotes the flow of bile, reduces inflammation of the bile duct, and helps get rid of gall stones. It’s good for chronic hepatitis, where it reduces liver swelling and jaundice, and it helps indigestion caused by insufficient bile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decoction's also a diuretic, and has been used for centuries or kidney problems and water retention.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>

      <field name="similarPlants">The common dandelion has no poisonous look-alikes. You can use other similar but less widespread &lt;i&gt;Taraxacum&lt;/i&gt; species the same way you'd use the common dandelion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other edible relatives, all with a white, milky latex, look very similar when young, but they're very different when they get older:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chicory's young leaves' teeth, which are smaller than dandelions' and are sometimes rounded, don't always point to the leaf bases, and there's often a reddish color on the leaf midrib. When it gets older, it grows a stem several feet tall and bears blue flowers. Dead sticks from the previous year's woody stem persist, arising from the basal rosette, into early spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild lettuce is also edible. Its young basal leaves resemble dandelions', but has more shallow teeth that don't all point toward the leaf base. The leaves have at least some hairs, they're triangular in cross section, and the plant gets much taller than the dandelion. The flowers grow in groups, not individually, and it has fibrous roots, not a taproot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sow thistle also edible and with taller with yellow flowers, has bristly leaves.</field>

      <field name="season">The shoots are in season in early spring, the flowers mainly in late spring and early summer, although a few bloom throughout the summer on cultivated varieties, and the tubers are in season all year.</field>

      <field name="howToSpot">Look for long, light green, sword-like basal leaves that become floppy when they get large. Rhizomes spread from the plant's base ending in tubers and large, showy, six-tepaled, orange, funnel-shaped flowers growing atop a slender, leafless stalk.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This colonial perennial produces dense stands of large, showy, edible flowers and flower buds above a basal rosette of long, sword-shaped leaves that you can also eat when they first come up, plus tubers that are in season all year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long, narrow, linear, basal leaves, which grow from one to three feet long with parallel veins, flop over as they get longer. When the shoots first appear in early spring, the leaves grow mostly in the same plane, and unite into a short, whitish, cylindrical to elliptoid base that grows one to two inches above ground level. Fleshy, light brown rhizomes under 0.25 inches in diameter spread from the base into the ground, each ending in a small, oblong, light brown tuber, whitish inside, about 0.75 inches long. The true roots emanate from the tubers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six to 15 large, showy, orange, short-stemmed, upward-facing, funnel-shaped flowers branch from a tall, slender, smooth, unbranched, leafless stem three to four feet tall. Three reflexed tepals, and three nearly-identical sepals, with grow to about four inches long. With ruffled edges, and a pale yellow line runs along each tepal's length. six long, pollen-covered stamens surround a single longer pistil inside each flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the flowering period, cylindrical, yellow-orange, lined flower buds, growing from 1.5 to three inches long just before they open, grow on the same short branches as the flowers, replenishing the flowers, which wither at the end of the same day that they open. Shriveled remnants of previous days flowers hang from some of the short  branches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild dayliles spread underground and don't set seed.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Sword-shaped leaves of the shoots arising from a cylindrical to ellipsoid, whitish base.&lt;br /&gt;•Rhizomes spreading into the ground from the base, ending in small, potato-like tubers&lt;br /&gt;•A long, unbranched, smooth, leafless flower stalk&lt;br /&gt;•Yellow-orange, cylindrical, lined flower buds&lt;br /&gt;•Large, showy, orange flowers with six tepals&lt;br /&gt;•One pale yellow line running the length of the center of each tepal&lt;br /&gt;•Six stamens and one pistil in each flower&lt;br /&gt;•No fruit or seeds on wild varieties</field>
      <field name="harvesting">One of the easiest renewable edible plants to harvest in quantity, you can twist off and bag handfuls of the shoots under eight inches tall (six inch tall shoots are the best) with your hands, or cut them with a knife or shears. And you can break off the flower buds and flowers with your fingers, and dig up the tubers with a shovel or trowel.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Use the young shoots raw in salads or sandwiches, or steam, sauté, or stir-fry them, and add them to soups, stews, or casseroles. Virtually any cooking method works with them, and their tasty, string bean/onion flavor always, shines through, no matter what other ingredients or spices accompany them. They cook in 10 to 15 minutes. Use shoots under eight inches tall. Larger ones become coarse, unpleasant to eat, and hard to digest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cook the larger unopened flower buds in recipes that call for green beans. The flavor is similar, and they cook in about 15 minutes. You can also reconstitute the previous day's wilted flowers in soups, or purée; them and use them as a flavorful thickener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flowers are sweet and pungent. Don't eat the green bases of the flowers, which are somewhat acrid. Add the flowers to salads that you're going to eat the same day, before they do their Cinderella (or &lt;i&gt;Mission Impossible&lt;/i&gt;) thing the same night. Italian and Chinese cooks dip the flowers in batter and deep-fry them. They're also excellent in soups, sold, dried, as "golden needles" in Chinese grocery stores, for use in traditional hot-and-sour soups. You can stuff the fresh flowers with with dried fruit, nuts, or sweetened vegan cottage cheese with sweet herbs, close them with toothpicks, and serve these stuffed daylilies as a fancy dessert at parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also scrub and slice the smaller, firm tubers (the larger, older, flaccid ones are terrible), and sauté them in olive oil with garlic, salt, and pepper, or add to soups, stews, or casseroles. They taste a little like nutty turnips. Some people love the tubers, but they are small and labor-intensive to clean, so I rarely prepare them.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">No nutritional information about the shoots is available, but the flowers and flower buds provide beta carotene, vitamin C and iron, and the tubers provide protein and essential fatty acids.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">About 1 out of 50 people can't tolerate daylilies, especially the tubers and shoots, more so if they eat them raw. These people experience diarrhea, sometimes with vomiting. Take a bite or two the first time you try daylilies, and increase your portions by small increments in the following days. If you ever begin to feel queasy or nauseous, avoid this plant. (This caution doesn't apply when my wife's attending a foraging tour—she'd be the 1-out-of-50 people who tolerates this plant about as badly as she tolerates my jokes!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there are rare genetic variants, otherwise identical to normal daylilies, that will cause such digestive distress in anyone who eats them. I've led hundreds of tours since 1982 where we've collected and eaten daylilies, and have never run into any of these varieties so they must be extremely rare, but there's reliable documentation that this has occurred. Again, try one or two bites the first time you try daylilies in a new location, and avoid collecting from a stand if it makes you a little queasy.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">The tiger-lily’s (&lt;i&gt;Lilium tigruinum&lt;/i&gt;) edible flowers are spotted, not lined, and its stem bears leaves, instead of being bare of leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cultivated daylilies come in different colors, sometimes with multiple sets of tepals, and these may even produce seeds. Although edible, they're not as tasty as the wild, orange varieties.</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Irises (&lt;i&gt;Iris spp.&lt;/i&gt;) and daffodils (&lt;i&gt;Narcissus spp.&lt;/i&gt;) have sword-shaped leaves when young, making them resemble daylily shoots. The flowers, which appear later on, differ greatly, and these plants don't have rhizomes ending in a tubers, so dig up daylilies to make sure you have the right plant before you eat the shoots. </field>

I never cook beans without adding some epazote, especially before an indoor speaking engagement. And a Nicaraguan man who attended one of my tours said it's name in his country translates to "fart buster!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Brazil, everyone knows it cures hangovers. It's infuriating to me why something so effective hasn't been investigated in lab experiments—it's enough to drive me to drink!</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Don't use epazote as a potherb. It's good for you in small quantities, but poisonous in large quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't use this herb if you're pregnant or lactating, and don't take the essential oil (which you'd have to buy, and is used externally for ringworm), extracted from the seeds, internally. It's considered toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there are certain individuals who should never use epazote. It can make them sick or kill them, even in small amounts. But don't worry, you can tell who these individuals are by determining their occupation: it's only harmful to lawyer or politicians—remember, it kills parasites!</field>

Spread on a try, blow away the chaff, and store the seeds in a tightly closed jar before using.</field>
      <field name="cooking">This is a very tasty, fiery-hot mustard, a little like black pepper and wasabe. Use the basal leaves, the leaves on the leafstalk, flowers, seedpods, and tender portions of the stems raw in salads or sandwiches, or cook them using virtually any method for about 10 minutes or until tender. Use sparingly unless you love spicy food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also make prepared mustard by grinding the seeds or green seedpods in a blender with vinegar to cover. Add salt or mellow miso, and turmeric (for yellow coloring) plus other spices typically used in making prepared mustard, , i.e., tarragon, white pepper, or garlic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're a kid, tell your friend the seeds are very sweet and feed some to him or her. You may lose a friend, but you'll laugh your head off!</field>
      <field name="nutrition">A good source of vitamin C, for a plant, the leaves are high in protein. They’re also a good source of B-complex vitamins and sulfur.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">An infusion of the seeds supposedly acts as a tonic. This plant has been used in herbal medicine for fevers, coughs, and various infections, and research backs this up—it has antimicrobial properties, suppressing the growth of staphylococcus and streptococcus. The whole plant is also a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, like aspirin.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>

      <field name="similarPlants">Other edible members of the mustard family have similar flowers, but the leaves are usually toothed or lobed, they don't clasp the stem, and none has the deeply notched, circular seed pods. Field peppergrass &lt;i&gt;(Lepidium campestre&lt;/i&gt;), for example, is a very similar edible relative with seedpods that aren't notched. Poor man's pepper, with basal leaves with teeth pointing toward the leaf base is another edible relative, as is shepherd's purse, which has triangular seedpods.</field>

Spread the seeds you've harvested on a tray and blow away any chaff with a fan, over the kitchen sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grind the seeds and use them with whole grain flour, for making breads, pancakes, or porridge. You can also cook the seeds in grain dishes, to add crunchiness and flavor. Unlike cultivated grains, foxtail grass seeds never become completely soft, an asset if you like crunchy foods.</field>

      <field name="group">Family: &lt;i&gt;Brassicaceae&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Cruciferae&lt;/i&gt;, the mustard or cabbage family</field>
      <field name="plantType"/>
      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">You can collect the basal leaves and taproots from late fall through early spring, the sprouts in early spring, the leafstalk's leaves in mid-spring, and the seeds from mid-summer to mid-fall.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Woodlands, disturbed habitats, parks, road- and trailsides, edge habitats, and wetlands</field>
      <field name="range">Most of North America</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Europe</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for endless basal rosettes of dark green, heavily veined, long-stalked, coarsely-toothed, heart-shaped leaves. Watch for flower stalks with alternate, triangular to arrow-shaped leaves and racemes of small, white, four-petaled flowers. Also examine woodland floors for the many erect, slender, unbranched, whitish skeletons with narrow, cylindrical, short-stalked, upward-curving, alternate seedpods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sniff for the fragrance of garlic when you crush the leaves or stem.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This common, healthful, highly invasive woodland biennial has a distinctive garlic smell when crushed, which helps protect it from insects (unless Italian insects find it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sprouts of new plants arising from seeds look like alfalfa sprouts, each with a single, slender, reddish stalk around two inches tall, and a single, strap-shaped leaf around 0.5 inch long. These arise among the basal rosettes coming from taproots of second-year plants, which take over great swaths of forest. Their long-stalked, scallop-edged, deeply-veined, kidney-shaped, garlic-scented leaves grow up to 2.5 inches across. The thin, white taproot smells and tastes like horseradish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By mid-spring, second-year plants grow a single erect stem one to 3.5 feet tall, slightly hairy, with more pointed, alternate, deeply veined, larger-toothed, triangular leaves. A broccoli-like flower bud soon gives way to clusters of four-petaled white flowers, each 0.33 inch across. Configured like a cross (typical of the mustard family), they also alternate around the flower stalk. These are soon replaced by long, green, slender, four-parted, cylindrical seedpods, one to 1.5 inches long, curving upward on short stalks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the second-year plant dies in the summer, the dry, whitish, short-stalked seedpods split lengthwise to reveal two rows of tiny, oblong, blackish, finely lined, spicy flavored seeds.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Basal rosette of long-stalked, coarsely toothed, deeply veined, dark green, heart-shaped leaves&lt;br /&gt;•one to 3.5 feet tall stem with triangular, coarsely toothed leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Small, broccoli-like flower buds&lt;br /&gt;•Clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers&lt;br /&gt;•Persistent slender, unbranched, upright, white skeleton with many long, narrow, cylindrical, alternate, short-stalked, upward-curved seedpods&lt;br /&gt;•Seedpod skeletons containing rows of tiny, oblong, blackish, ribbed seeds&lt;br /&gt;•Slender, white taproot that smells like horseradish&lt;br /&gt;•Leaves, stem, flower buds, and flowers smelling like garlic when crushed&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Pick the sprouts with your fingers. It's as easy to pull off handfuls of basal leaves with your fingers too. You can quickly strip leaves, soft parts of the upper stems, flower buds, and flowers from the mature plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the soil is soft and moist, you can sometimes pull on the top of the taproot under the basal rosette with your hand to uproot it. Otherwise, use a shovel or trowel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gently break off lots of dried seed heads and transfer them into a supermarket paper shopping bag. By the time you get home, many of the seeds will have fallen out of the pods. Rub the pods with your hands to loosen the rest of the seeds over a tray, and use a fan to blow the seeds into your sink. Store the seeds in a tightly closed glass jar, they last indefinitely.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The leaves all taste like garlic, with bitter and spicy overtones. The young leaves on the developing flower stalk and the accompanying flower buds and flowers, which taste hot and sweet as well, are better than the basal leaves in early spring, which are good too. Use them sparingly in any savory recipe, with other flavorful ingredients, to counteract the bitterness that concentrates as cooking shrinks the leaves. You can use any cooking method. They cook ready in about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basal leaves are edible in the cold weather seasons, but they also have an overtone of bitterness that doesn't disappear when you sauté them and cook them in a liquid, which works with dandelions and its relatives. Use them sparingly in salads or sandwiches. On the other hand, this plant makes superb pestos, where even the bitterness of the cold weather season basal leaves disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the seeds to spice up anything you want. Unlike hard commercial mustard seeds, which you usually have to grind, these seeds are soft enough to chew, and they add texture as well as spiciness to any recipe. Since they burn when you sauté them, add [-them] to recipes at the end of the cooking process if possible, to avoid dissipating their flavor. Tthey also work well baked, in place of caraway or poppy seeds in breads and rolls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the horseradish-flavored root just like horseradish for extra spiciness in any recipe. Like horseradish, the flavor is volatile—cooking destroys it. So add this at the end of a recipe, or use raw as a garnish. To preserve the root, grate or finely chop it, cover with vinegar immediately, and refrigerate. This lasts indefinitely.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Garlic mustard is a good source of vitamins A, C, and E, some of the B vitamins, plus potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper, iron and manganese. Like other mustards, it contains plant estrogens that are inert in humans (they're probably designed by natural selection to interfere with insects' development), but block human and synthetic estrogens from promoting the unwanted cell proliferation that can lead to cancer. The sulfur-containing amino acids that give it its garlic odor, like garlic, promote cardiovascular health. Pretty impressive for a despised invasive weed!</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Not a major traditional medicinal plant, garlic mustard has been little used in herbal medicine, although an infusion of the leaves has been used as a diaphoretic to cause sweating, stimulate the immune system and treat bronchitis. People have heated the root in oil and applied this ointment to the chest for bronchitis too. I have no idea whether or not this works, but juice from the leaves does inhibit the growth of gram negative bacteria, which includes those that cause gastric enteritis and typhoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have also applied the crushed leaves to insect bites and stings, although I've had such good results with jewelweed and common plantain that I've never tried garlic mustard for bug bites.</field>

      <field name="group">Family: &lt;i&gt;Polygonaceae&lt;/i&gt;, the knotweed or smartweed family</field>
      <field name="plantType"/>
      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">You can eat this plant only in early spring, while the shoots are tender. On very rare occasions, new edible shoots come up in the fall after the mature plants have been cut down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inedible flowers bloom in the summer, the inedible seeds ripen in the fall, and the inedible dead stalks persist through the winter into the following spring.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Partial shade or full sunlight, disturbed habitats, roadsides, fields, and riverbanks.</field>
      <field name="range">Throughout most of North America.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Asia</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">In early spring, look for upright, unbranched, green shoots that resemble asparagus, but flecked with red, pink, and magenta, and divided by joints below sheathes. Look for them among the previous year's dead stems, which create conspicuous bamboo-like thickets. Later in the spring, and in the summer and fall, look for the four to six inch-long, alternate, toothless, pointed, three-sided leaves, and lacy spikes of small white flowers or seeds.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This tall, bushy, bamboo-like invasive Asian perennial creates stands of reddish, bamboo-like shoots with a wonderfully sour flavor, in early spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing 0.5 to 1.25 inches wide, the upright, unbranched, young, green shoots are dappled with red, pink, and magenta, beginning in the middle of early spring. Whitish, papery sheaths grow upward from regularly spaced joints. Later on, the tall, hollow, conspicuous, woody, jointed mature stems grow nine to 12 feet tall, and create what looks like a bamboo thicket. The dead stalks persist through the winter and into the following spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaped like bulging triangles, the large, alternate, pointed, toothless leaves, with flat bases and pointed tips, grow to four to six inches long and 2.5 to 4.25 inches wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hundreds of tiny, attractive-looking, greenish-white flowers grow on many long, lacy spikes in the summer, to be replaced by many tiny, three-sided, smooth, beige, papery fruits in autumn. Each contains one tiny, hard, brown seed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An underground network of interconnected rhizomes is the bane of many gardeners' existence.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Upright, unbranched, jointed, green shoots in early spring spotted with red, pink, and magenta&lt;br /&gt;•Whitish sheaths above the joints&lt;br /&gt;•Skeleton's of the previous year's growth of hollow, jointed, woody, bamboo-like stalks, persisting into the following spring&lt;br /&gt;•Smooth-edged, bulging-triangular leaves, four to six inches long and 2.5 to 4.25 inches wide, with pointed tips and straight bases&lt;br /&gt;•Long spikes of tiny, white flowers, followed by small, smooth, papery fruits, arising from the leaf axils</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Break or cut off the shoots near ground level, discard the inedible leaves, and bag. Those six to eight inches tall are best—you can collect a lot in a very short period of time, and you don't have to peel them. Smaller ones are more labor intensive to collect, while larger shoots tend to get tough rinds, which you need to peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time the shoots reach four feet tall, only the tops are tender enough to peel and eat. Also, the flesh becomes thinner, so there's increasingly more work for less food, until they become completely inedible in mid-spring.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Discard the leaves and chop or slice the intensely sour young shoots. Use them sparingly in fruit dishes, to contrast the fruit's sweet flavor, the same way people use rhubarb, a relative. A 10 to 1 ratio works well. The shoots taste great in pies, cobblers, cakes, and pastries. Or incorporate a small proportion into applesauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shoots are also excellent in larger quantities as a sour addition to soups, stews, and casseroles, especially recipes with bland and creamy ingredients, i.e., potatoes or squash. They even slightly thicken such recipes, the way okra does. And they're wonderful in ice creams and sorbets (similar to lemon sorbet), as well as in puddings and jams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the larger shoots get tough, you can poke in a chopstick to punch through the membrane separating segments of the peeled shoots, insert a sweet or savory stuffing, and bake, with or without a sauce. Using Italian ingredients, I make Knot Ziti (no, I really did, and it's in my &lt;i&gt;Wild Vegan Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; too, believe it or knot!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You usually discard the rinds of older shoots, but you can also substitute them for orange rind and cook them in sweetened orange juice thickened with agar to make Knot Marmalade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are thousands of recipes that require sour ingredients. Use your imagination, and I'm sure you'll come up with some wonderfully original ideas that can turn into some awesome recipes.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Japanese knotweed shoots provide vitamins A and C, the antioxidant flavonoid rutin, and the minerals potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and manganese. It’s also an excellent source of resveratrol, also found in the skin of red grapes and in red wine, which lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol, and reduces the risk of heart disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Large quantities may act as a gentle laxative, like rhubarb. This mucilaginous vegetable is also very soothing to the stomach and intestines, and its mild acidity helps break up fat and stimulate digestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease, Japanese knotweed's resveratrol may delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, or slow its progression. Normally, glial cells in the brain support the neurons, but in Alzheimer’s disease, an accumulation of characteristic amyloid plaques signal these helper cells to kill the neurons instead. The research is preliminary, but resveratrol seems to block this deadly signal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, extracts of this plant have shown anti-tumor activity. It might turn out to help treat cancer, or lower the risk of coming down with it.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">This roots of this plant can be deadly, but only to gardeners. Once the rhizomes get permanently established in the gardens, there follows a period of torturous struggle, until the exhausted gardener dies of aggravation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't eat large quantities of Japanese knotweed raw. It has much more oxalic acid than cooked knotweed, and this may cause problems. </field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Giant knotweed (&lt;i&gt;P. sachalinense&lt;/i&gt;) is similar to Japanese knotweed, but significantly larger and much less common. You use both plants the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild asparagus shoots, also edible, of course, have no sheathes or reddish flecks, and the leaves, flowers, and fruits are completely different.</field>

A slightly darkened triangular spot (chevron), the "lady's thumbprint," often appears toward the leaf's center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swollen, reddish-tinged nodes grow along the stem at regular intervals.

Adults, on the other hand, often find them bland, sometimes suggesting that they're as tasteless as my jokes, but they go well in salads or sandwiches to contrast and offset our many strong-tasting wild greens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also sauté them with other more flavorful ingredients, or add them in soups, stews, and casseroles.

      <field name="plantType"/>
      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">The leaves are in season from mid-spring through mid-fall, the seeds in late fall.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Rich soil, sunny or partially shaded habitats, disturbed habitats, roadsides, fields, agricultural land, edge habitats, parks.</field>
      <field name="range">Throughout North America</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Native to North America and Europe, the seeds are so small, a muddy-footed migrating bird blown of course by a storm could have transported it across the Atlantic either way in prehistoric times.</field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a tall, branching, hairless odorless plant with diamond-shaped leaves that are mealy white underneath and dense spikes of tiny, green flowers toward the top branches.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This common, odorless annual, with many branching stems is one of our best wild vegetables. It usually grows from three to five feet tall, (sometimes up to 10 feet), with slender, grooved stems often tinged with red—especially next to the leaf axils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lambs-quarters leaves surprising take two forms. Mealy whitish underneath, the alternate, diamond-shaped, wavy toothed, mature leaves you see most of the time grow up to four inches long. The youngest leaves at the tips of the branches, on the other hand, are much smaller, linear, and white all over. The leaf stalks grow to about half the length of the leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiny, green, inconspicuous, bad-tasting, ball-like flowers grow in short, dense spikes in the upper leaf axils and at the plant’s tip, in the summer and fall, eventually turning reddish-brown. By late fall, as many as 75,000 tiny, shiny, cylindrical black seeds per plant grow inside.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Branching plant three to five feet tall or more&lt;br /&gt;•Diamond-shaped, coarsely toothed mature leaves with mealy white undersides&lt;br /&gt;•Linear, young leaves, glistening white all over&lt;br /&gt;•Dense spikes of small, green, spherical flowers on the upper leaf axils&lt;br /&gt;•Dense spikes of small, green, spherical fruits on the upper leaf axils, turning reddish in autumn&lt;br /&gt;•Ripe fruits filled with tiny black seeds,&lt;br /&gt;•Virtually no odor&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="harvesting">To harvest the leaves, pinch off the whole very young plant while it's a few inches tall, and the stem is still tender enough to break easily. Strip off the leaves of older plants with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to amaranth, it's more difficult to get a good harvest of these seeds, so look for the dead plants in late fall where they're tall and very abundant. Clip off large numbers of seed clusters with kitchen scissors, pruning shears, or a pocket knife. Stuff them into paper supermarket shopping bags and let them dry out a couple of weeks if necessary (you can store them indefinitely this way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rub the dry seed heads (this works with fresh seed heads too, but it's less efficient) over a bowl to loosen the seeds. Transfer them to a tray or cookie sheet and blow a fan across the tray over a sink, or outdoors, to get rid of the chaff. Use the seeds immediately, or store indefinitely in tightly closed jars.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Lamb's-quarters leaves taste somewhat like its relative, spinach. Use them, and very young whole plants, like spinach—raw, saut&amp;#233ed;, steamed, simmered in soups, baked in quiches, or in any recipe that calls for raw or cooked greens. They cook in 5 to 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cook the nutty flavored seeds as you would a grain: Boil them in water to cover for about 15 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the seeds are soft, like rice. You may use soy-, nut-, or oat milk instead of water, plus fresh or dried fruit, sweet herbs (i.e., mint, cinnamon, ginger), and a sweetener, to make a sweet hot cereal. To make the seeds more nutty tasting, toast them in a pan over medium a few minutes, until they pop, stirring very often, before adding the liquid.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Lamb's-quarters leaves provide more vitamin A, calcium, potassium, and iron than anything you can buy. They also contain B-complex vitamins and vitamin C, as well as many trace minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seeds provide protein, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and niacin.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses"></field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">Sometimes lamb's-quarters' leaves are blotched with red. This indicates insect damage. There's even a tiny leaf miner that burrows between the top and bottom surface of the leaves. Don't eat these marred leaves. Also, avoid plants growing in soil polluted with nitrates, which they can pick up and pass on to you, causing nitrate poisoning.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Lamb's-quarters has some similar-looking, edible relatives that you can use the same way as lamb's-quarters:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Strawberry blight (&lt;i&gt;C. capitatum&lt;/i&gt;) has more triangular leaves than lambs-quarters’—sometimes even arrow shaped, with more of the rounded flowers, and mild-flavored, bright red fruits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Poverty weed (&lt;i&gt;Monolepsis nuttalliana&lt;/i&gt;) is a fleshy, branching, sprawling annual that grows up to one foot tall, with lance-shaped, alternate, mealy-textured leaves about 0.5 to 2.5 inches long, usually irregularly toothed but sometimes smooth, with a pair of lobes at the bases. Its brown fruits are flattened. It grows in alkaline or dry soil from the eastern edge of the Great Plains to California, and from Southern Canada to Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Orache (&lt;i&gt;Atriplex patula&lt;/i&gt;) is a salty tasting edible that grows near the seashore and in salty, alkaline soil throughout the country, with arrow-shaped instead of diamond-shaped leaves. Much touted by other authors, I've always found it to have an unpleasantly bitter aftertaste. Maybe this uninspiring plant is better cooked, or other &lt;i&gt;Atriplex&lt;/i&gt; species taste better. </field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Epazote is edible when used as a seasoning, but poisonous when eaten in large quantities, as you would with lamb's-quarters. However, although it branches and its flower clusters look similar to lamb's-quarters', its strong, resinous odor alone will distinguish it from the nearly odorless lamb's-quarters. Also, its leaves are oblong to lance-shaped, without powdery-white undersides, unlike lamb's-quarters' diamond-shaped leaves with powdery white undersides.</field>

      <field name="season">You can cook the leaves in early spring, and make tea with any part above-ground part of the plant from early spring to late fall.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Sunny and partially shaded habits, nitrogenous soil, disturbed habitats, old fields, meadows, roadsides, ditches, parks, edges, and thickets</field>
      <field name="range">Eastern North America, southern Canada, the Pacific Northwest, and California</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Eurasia</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for dense colonies of tall, downy plants (or a ground cover where it's been mowed) with deeply cut lower and linear upper leaves, whitish underneath,[and] dense clusters of tiny, inconspicuous, green flowers. Scratch and sniff for an intense grassy medicinal odor when crushed.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Growing from two to 12 feet tall with a stem often tinged with red and purple that becomes somewhat woody, this very common, downy, fragrant, Eurasian colonial invasive perennial takes over sunny, open areas anywhere it's been introduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointed, alternate, stalked, toothed, mature leaves, dark green on top, are covered with mats of tiny whitish hairs underneath. Two  to four inches long and one to three inches wide, they look a little like parsley—partially divided and subdivided many times, as though snipped with scissors. The upper leaves are less divided, sometimes linear, and often stalkless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer and fall, many tiny, green, cottony flowers, sometimes reddish-brown at the tips, grow on long, upright, leafy panicles. The tiny green fruits release even smaller achenes attached to tiny, white parachutes into the air, like dandelions, which belong to the same large family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The root system consists of woody rhizomes that secrete herbicides to kill competitors, ensuring that mugwort often grows in monocultures of dense stands.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Dense stands of medium-sized to tall plants with deeply lobed, stalked mature leaves, and linear immature leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Persistent woody skeletons of previous years' growth&lt;br /&gt;•Leaves with tiny, matted, whitish-green hairs underneath&lt;br /&gt;•Many tiny greenish flowers growing on long, upright spikes&lt;br /&gt;•A strong odor like tarragon and camphor when crushed</field>
      <field name="harvesting">To use as food, pinch off the young plants with your fingers. For tea or for dreaming, break, strip, or clip off any of the above-ground parts of the plant.</field>
      <field name="cooking">This is a bitter relative of wormwood and not the best-tasting of wild foods. Nonetheless, Korea people dip the young leaves in batter when the plants are but a few inches tall, and deep-fry this. In China and Japan, mugwort's used to flavor rice cakes, and in Japan, it's used in making soba (buckwheat) noodles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also stuff a pillow with the soft parts of the plants. It gives some people vivid dreams, although they may or may not be pleasant.</field>
      <field name="nutrition"></field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">A major herb in traditional Chinese medicine, mugwort contains the fragrant, volatile oil psilostachyin, as well as biologically active ketones and alkaloids. Dried mugwort leaves and roots are used for moxa treatments, where it's burned in cups placed over acupuncture points. And it's served with fatty meals in China and Eastern Europe, to stimulate the secretion of bile to help digest the fat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chinese also use an infusion or tincture of the leaves and roots for anxiety, stress, insomnia, mild depression, irritability, restlessness, and menstrual problems—taken twice a day starting a week before menstruation, a strong infusion of the leaves greatly reduces or eliminates PMS symptoms and cramps. I can attest the this personally: Ever since I learned this plant, I've never had a cramp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Mugwort contains the controversial substance thujone, a possible hallucinogen well-known for its presence in notorious alcoholic beverage, absinthe, made with mugwort's relative, absinthe wormwood (&lt;i&gt;A. absinthium&lt;/i&gt;). So many deaths were attributed to absinthe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that it had been banned worldwide. Nowadays those deaths are attributed to plain old alcoholism, because there's too little thujone in absinthe to cause poisoning, and the "green fairy" is legal again. Furthermore, mugwort is so bitter, it's unlikely anyone could possibly consume enough to cause harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mugwort is also closely related to ragweed (&lt;i&gt;Artemesia spp.&lt;/i&gt;), a major cause of hay fever. Although I don't have hay fever, just smelling mugwort gives me a bad headache, so I certainly don't eat it or cook with it. Avoid the plant altogether if you have hay fever or are allergic to ragweed.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Common ragweed (&lt;i&gt;Ambrosia artemisiifolia&lt;/i&gt;) looks a little like mugwort, but its leaves are more finely dissected, it's not fragrant, and the leaves aren't light-colored underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chrysanthemums (&lt;i&gt;Chrysanthemum spp.&lt;/i&gt;) look a little like mugwort, but their leaves are much larger, they're not light green underneath, they only grow in gardens, and they have large, showy flowers.</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">This large, stout, smooth, widely branching, purple-tinged, native perennial grows from four to nine feet tall, and dies to the ground in the winter, leaving a whitish skeleton that overwinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In mid-early spring, the young, reddish-tinged, stout, unbranched shoot grows to about one inch thick. The oval, toothless, alternate leaves wrap around the stem and point upward at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in the spring, the elliptical, entire, stalked, alternate, emerald-green leaves grow form eight to 12 inches long, and 2.5 to five inches wide. They're sometimes mottled by a plant mosaic virus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing on drooping, six to eight inch long, terminal racemes, the stalked, radially-symmetrical flowers grow to about 0.5 inch across, each with a green central ovary, ten stamens, and five petal-like white sepals, but no true petals. They bloom from summer to fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the sepals fall off in late summer or fall, the ovary enlarges and becomes a shiny, dark, purple, juicy, stalked, spherical berry 0.33 inch across, composed of five to 12 segments fused into a ring. Each berry, filled with tiny, hard seeds, is indented on both ends, as though poked. The magenta raceme droops with the weight of the berries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fleshy, light tan, perennial taproot can become enormous over the years.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Break or cut off the shoots no taller than ten inches with your hands, in mid-spring only. Be absolutely certain that you haven't accidentally harvested any pieces of the poisonous taproots! Collect only in the spring. Avoid any plants beginning to flower, which will be much larger than ten inches anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collect the berries for medicinal purposes when they're dark purple and juicy, from mid-summer through fall.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The puffer fish (&lt;i&gt;Tetraodontidae spp.&lt;/i&gt;) of the vegetable kingdom, this plant has an indescribably delicious flavor if prepared properly, deadly if not. But it's easy to prepare pokeweed properly: Set up two pots of rapidly boiling water, a medium-sized cooking pot and a larger reserve pot. Never use cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse the pokeweed shoots and chop into bite-sized pieces. Boil 1 minute in the medium-sized pot, drain in a colander, return to the cooking pot, cover with more boiling water from the reserve pot, boil another minute, drain again, return to the cooking pot, pour in more boiling water, and boil until the pokeweed's been boiled for a total of 15 to 20 minutes. This is necessary to be sure you've removed all the poisons, which are water-soluble. Drain thoroughly in a colander, pressing the pokeweed against the colander's sides with a large wooden- or slotted spoon, so it isn't soggy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you could certainly serve this boiled pokeweed with a dash of olive oil plus salt and pepper to taste, it's especially delicious with more seasonings. For example, you could lightly sauté some chopped garlic in olive oil until lightly browned (be carefully not to overcook the garlic, or it will become very bitter) and stir that into the drained, hot pokeweed, along with some tamari soy sauce (the high-quality soy sauce sold in health food stores). Or choose a different oil and matching seasonings from any of the world's many great cuisines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also add the boiled pokeweed, seasoned or unseasoned, to any variety of vegetable recipes or entrées—soups, stews, grain dishes, ethnic dishes, or others.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Pokeweed is a great source of vitamin A, a fat-soluble vitamin that's not destroyed by boiling. It also contains vitamins B1, B2, B3, and C, plus the minerals calcium, phosphorus, and iron, but these are probably dissipated by the necessary boiling.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Although none of the hundreds of people attending my tours every year since 1982 has ever gotten sick from eating this plant prepared according to my directions, this is still not a plant for unsupervised beginners. Pokeweed contains phytolaccatoxin and related triterpene saponins, an alkaloid called phytolaccin, plus histamines. Even if you don't know what these substances are, they can kill you: Poisoning causes burning of mouth and throat, salivation, severe stomach irritation, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, spasms, and convulsions. Without prompt medical attention, the accompanying severe dehydration can lead to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never eat pokeweed raw, never eat the roots, flowers, or seeds; use only shoots no more than eight inches tall, during springtime only. Never eat pokeweed when it's in flower, or getting close to flowering, when the concentration of poisons skyrockets. Cook only as directed above. Make sure you don't accidentally include any pieces of the highly toxic root when you collect the shoots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I know people from the Deep South, where people have been eating this wild food for centuries, who eat the new, young growth in the summer with no harm, there are reports to the contrary in the literature, so I've never taken this unnecessary risk myself, and strongly advise against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although some people have reportedly gotten away with eating the berries (which aren't even supposed to be tasty), they're dangerous too, and should be avoided. Also, the seeds inside the berries are highly toxic.  </field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Anyone who confuses the term poke &lt;i&gt;sallet&lt;/i&gt; (an old English word for &lt;i&gt;cooked&lt;/i&gt; vegetable) with poke &lt;i&gt;salad&lt;/i&gt; is in for a surprise tour of the emergency room. This is not a food for people on a raw food diet!</field>

      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Europe</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">In early spring and fall, look for basal rosettes of deeply lobed or toothed leaves with no colored sap and sharp teeth mostly pointing toward the leaf tip. From mid-spring to fall, look for a medium-sized plant with flower and seed stalks resembling bottle brushes, tiny, white, four-petaled flowers, and small, flat, nearly circular, very slightly notched seedpods.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This small to medium-sized, spicy-flavored, exotic annual grows six inches to three feet tall, beginning with a basal rosette in early spring. The narrow, stalked, lobed basal leaves grow two to five inches long. The basal leaves soon exchange their lobes for deep, sharp teeth that usually point toward the leaf tips. The rosette disappears when the plant flowers, so people who recognize it at one stage often have to re-learn what it looks in its other form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resembling a bottle brush, a long, wiry, branching flower stalk grows from the rosette's center from mid-spring to fall, with similar but smaller alternate, linear to lance-shaped, toothed leaves, tapering toward the base. There's usually no leaf stalk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From spring to fall, many tiny, short-stalked flowers 0.125 inch across, each with four white petals configured like a cross (typical of the mustard family), bloom at the tips of the branches, on racemes. In the summer and fall, they’re replaced from the bottom up by many small, flat, circular-to-ovate, short-stalked seed pods, very slightly notched at the tips, growing 0.125 inch across. Tiny yellow-brown seeds fall out as the plant dies and the seed pods turn white. This white skeleton often persists into the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no colored sap when you break open the plant, which has a short, slender, white taproot. </field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Basal rosette of lobed or toothed leaves, no colored sap&lt;br /&gt;•Teeth on all leaves pointing mostly toward the leaves' tips&lt;br /&gt;•Bottle brush-like branched flower stalk up to three feet high&lt;br /&gt;•Tiny, white, four-petaled flowers on racemes&lt;br /&gt;•Small, flat, nearly circular to ovate seed pods, slightly notched at the tips</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Although you can certainly tear off the basal leaves with your fingers, it's much more effective to sweep a pocket knife under the rosette to sever the root and gain the entire rosette. Then you can shake off the debris and bag the plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strip off the leaves, seed pods, and flowers (the wiry stem is too tough to eat) with any tender parts of the stem's top. This is easier if you proceed from the top to the bottom of the stem.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Poor man's pepper is one of the best-tasting mustards around, with a peppery flavor (what else would you expect?) a little like radish, horseradish, and wasabe. The chopped leaves, as well as the seeds and flowers, are great added raw to salads and sandwiches, or cooked for 10 minutes like any other greens, in soups, stews, casseroles, sauces, or virtually any savory dish, although they lose some of their pungency when you cook them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can even roll the chopped plant into a sheet of toasted nori (a seaweed available in health food or Asian grocery stores and health food stores) with cooked rice and vegetables, to make &lt;i&gt;vegetarian sushi&lt;/i&gt; (don't forget to include a few pieces of a chopped vegetarian!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seeds are too small to use, but you can make prepared mustard with the seed pods. Cover them with a mild vinegar in a blender, and pur&amp;#233e; with turmeric (for color) and garlic, plus mellow miso (available in health food stores) for texture. Other spices, such as those on label of your favorite prepared mustard, i.e., tarragon or lemon rind, are optional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could even eat the taproot, but it's too small to be worth it.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">The leaves provide vitamin C, calcium, iron, and potassium.</field>

They [both] have larger seed pods, and leaves that clasp the flower stalk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shepherd’s purse (&lt;i&gt;Capsella bursa-pastoris&lt;/i&gt;), another edible relative, has leaves that clasp the stem, with lobes pointing outward no sharp teeth, plus heart-shaped rather than circular seedpods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unrelated dandelions (&lt;i&gt;Taraxacum officinale&lt;/i&gt;), chicory (&lt;i&gt;Cichorium intybus&lt;/i&gt;), and wild lettuce (&lt;i&gt;Lactuca spp.&lt;/i&gt;), all edible, have white, milky sap, which poor man's pepper lacks, and their leaves' teeth never point toward the leaf tips.</field>

      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a prostrate plant with a thick, smooth, succulent, purple-red stem, and stalkless, paddle-shaped leaves, growing in sunny places with very poor soil.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This sprawling, smooth, thick succulent's purple-red stem grows four to ten inches long and up to six inches tall. With its fleshy, alternate or opposite, stalkless, toothless, paddle-shaped leaves, 0.5  to two inches long, it provides foragers everywhere with an abundant supply of tasty, nutritious food every summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blooming from mid-summer to late summer, inconspicuous, tiny, yellow flowers only 0.2 inch wide, with five petals and two sepals, hide in the leaf axils or the tips of the branches, opening only on sunny mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ovoid fruit capsules replace the flowers in late summer. Up to 0.25 inch long, they split in half when they're ready to spill their tiny, hard, roundish, black seeds, each the size of poppy seeds,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purslane's small taproot gives rise to many fibrous secondary roots.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Simply break off the stems and bag them with the leaves, discarding any especially thick stems if they appear somewhat woody. The seeds, although edible, are far too few and too small bothering with.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Chop the leaves and stems and add them, raw, to salads and sandwiches. The mild sweet-sour flavor and crunchy texture make purslane idea for virtually any cooking method, and great in any kind of vegetable dish or entr&amp;#233e;. It cooks in about 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it's mucilaginous, it will thicken soups, stews, and sauces the way okra does. You may even set aside the leaves, which would fall off, and pickle the stems. </field>
      <field name="nutrition">One of the most nutritious foods on the planet, purslane provides vitamins A and C, some vitamin-complex B and carotenoids, plus the minerals magnesium, calcium, potassium, and iron. It also contains more omega-3 fatty acids, especially alpha-linolenic acid, than any other plant, and it's an excellent source of icosapentaenoic acid  (EPA). Furthermore, it provides reddish betacyanins and the yellow betaxanthins, both of which have anti-mutagenic effects, and may lower the risk of cancer.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Purslane is used to treat infections or uro-genital bleeding, as well as dysentery, in traditional Chinese medicine. The fresh herb has also been applied topically for skin sores, and insect and snake bites. Eating it also greatly reduces the symptoms of oral lichen planus, an autoimmune disease of unknown causes that effects the mouth's mucus membranes.</field>

      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Spurge (&lt;i&gt;Euphorbia spp.&lt;/i&gt;) doesn't look very much like purslane. It does sprawl along the ground, but it has elliptical, not paddle-shaped leaves, the stem is wiry, not succulent, the flowers are white, and it exudes a sickly looking white sap when cut. But because it often grows side-by-side with purslane, this acrid poison could accidentally wind up in your bag if you're not wary.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Pick the young leaves and the flower heads by hand. If you're using the flowers for tea, including a few mature leaves won't do any harm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best time to collect the flowers is when the greatest number of plants have come into full flower at the same time, and most of the flowers are brightly colored, usually in late spring. Collect only the most attractive-looking flower heads. These are the best. Avoid those that still include some immature, green flowers, and those with brown, withered flowers. They're terrible. Leave those for the health food stores, which sell brown dried herbs that must have been picked as they were going bad, since freshly dried herbs retain their color.</field>
      <field name="cooking">You can also pull the flowers off the flower heads with your fingers and add them (the flowers, not your finger!) raw, to salads. Or cook the flowers in virtually any dish that calls for vegetables. They cook in about 10 to 15 minutes. Although somewhat fibrous, they taste like sweet snap peas. I also like showering them, raw, onto ice cream, where they make colorful, sweet sprinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also dehydrate them, grind them into powder in a blender in a blender, and use them to supplement the protein of whole grains in breads and muffins. This works for the completely brown, dry flower heads, which contain the seeds, too, although they're not as tasty as the flowers. Add the meal of either to whole-grain flour to use in breads, pancakes, and muffins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red clover infusion, made with the freshest flower heads along with a few of the leaves, has been popular since prehistoric times. You can add a few of the youngest leaves raw, to salads, although they're hard to digest. It's much better to cook them like other greens, for about 15 minutes. They're not one of my favorite vegetables, with a raw string bean/turnip flavor, but some people like them.</field>

      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a plant with basal rosettes of arrow-shaped, long-stalked leaves in early spring and fall, and racemes of the reddish-tinged, branching, flowering stems with small, alternate, arrow-shaped leaves in the summer.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This unique plant has mature leaves that resemble a sheep’s face—there’s a pointed &lt;i&gt;nose&lt;/i&gt; at the tip, and two spreading &lt;i&gt;ears&lt;/i&gt; (lobes) perpendicular to the arrow-shaped leaf’s broad base, although the very youngest leaves are oval. A papery sheath wraps around the stem adjacent to the leaf axils, typical of the knotweed family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spreading by rhizomes, this hairless European perennial, which also has a taproot, begins in early spring with a basal rosette with long-stalked leaves 1.5 to three inches long. New rosettes develop in the fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A slender, branched, deeply ridged, jointed stem 1.5 to nine (sometimes up to 18) inches tall, with much smaller, alternate, stalkless leaves that may be arrow-shaped or linear, grows in mid-spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long, lacy, loosely branched racemes of tiny, yellow-green male flowers, plus tiny reddish female flowers, bloom on the upper stalks in late spring and early summer. Tiny, inconspicuous, reddish to yellow-brown fruits in papery wrappers also ripen in the summer.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Long-stalked arrow-shaped basal leaves in early spring and fall&lt;br /&gt;•Very young basal leaves oval to linear&lt;br /&gt;•Branching stem in mid-spring and summer, with racemes of tiny, reddish flowers&lt;br /&gt;•Leaves strongly lemon-flavored</field>
      <field name="harvesting">The basal leaves are the best ones, although the stem leaves are edible too. Grab a bunch with one hand, hold down the leaf stalks with the other, and break off the leaves. You can also strip the leaves off the flower stalks with your fingers.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Sheep sorrel basal leaves have an intensely lemony flavor, much better than commercial garden sorrel (&lt;i&gt;R. acetosa&lt;/i&gt;). People who try it say: "Not b...a...a..a...d!" It's so tasty, I eat it at every opportunity. The leaves on the stem aren't as good, and the flowers are unpleasantly bitter and astringent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the leaves raw in salads and sandwiches. They're excellent in soups and stews, cooked about 10 minutes, but you can use them in any dish that calls for leafy vegetables. As with most strongly flavored ingredients, they complement mild, creamy ones, such as potatoes or squash. You can even bake them into bread, where their strong flavor won't get lost.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Sheep sorrel provides vitamins C, A, B-complex, D, E, K, P and U, plus the minerals calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium,  silicon, iron, sulfur, copper, iodine, manganese, and zinc.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Don't believe the inaccurate scare-literature that says sheep sorrel is dangerous because it contains oxalic acid. Unless you have kidney stones, it's no more hazardous than spinach, and people have been enjoying it in good health for thousands of years.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Bindweed (&lt;i&gt;Convolvulus spp.&lt;/i&gt;) also has arrow-shaped leaves, but it's a vine, not an upright plant, and its large, funnel-shaped flowers look like its relative, morning glory (&lt;i&gt;Ipomoea purpurea.&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wood sorrel (&lt;i&gt;Rumex spp.&lt;/i&gt;) also protects itself from non-human herbivores with a lemony flavor, but this unrelated edible has nothing else in common with sheep sorrel other than its flavor and name.</field>

      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">The basal leaves are edible in early spring, and mid- to late fall, when new ones often come up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flower buds and flowers are available in mid-spring.</field>
      <field name="habitat">One of the first plants to colonize newly disturbed habitats, it grows in full sunlight or partial shade, along roadsides, and in fields, pastures, lawns, and parks.</field>
      <field name="range">Throughout most of North America.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Europe</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for basal rosettes of blunt-lobed or toothed, lance-shaped leaves, with lobes facing outward, in early spring. In mid-spring, look for the addition of long, slender, branching stems with loosely configured, heart-shaped or triangular seed pods, plus tiny, four-petaled, white flowers on top.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Shepherd’s purse begins with a basal rosette of stalked, lobed to deeply toothed, lance-shaped leaves up to nine inches long, broader toward the tip, arising from a slender, white taproot. Unlike similar-looking rosettes, the leaves' lobes point outward, and there's no white, milky sap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In mid-spring, long, wiry, erect flower stalks, branching from the base, grow from eight inches to 2.5 feet tall. Smaller, alternate, stalkless, lance-shaped or linear leaves, sometimes with tiny teeth, clasp the stems with two small, pointed lobes at their bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing on loose terminal racemes, tiny, stalked flowers, growing inside four green, oval sepals, have four white petals that form a cross, typical of the mustard family. Maturing from the bottom up, the flowers metamorphosize into long-stalked, flattened, heart-shaped to triangular, two-parted seed pods 0.25 inch long, with very tiny seeds inside.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Basal rosette of lance-shaped, blunt-lobed or deeply toothed leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Lobes pointing laterally&lt;br /&gt;•Lobes larger toward the leaf's tip&lt;br /&gt;•Slender, wiry stems up to 2.5 feet high, branching at the base&lt;br /&gt;•Racemes of tiny, four-petaled, white flowers at the tops of the stems&lt;br /&gt;•Loose racemes of small, heart-shaped to triangular seed pods&lt;br /&gt;•Small, white, hairy taproot</field>
      <field name="harvesting">While you can certainly grab handfuls of leaves, cutting the root just under the center of the rosette with a pocketknife gets you the entire rosette in a second, and while it's still intact, you can shake off most of the debris before bagging the plant. The basal leaves become tough after the stem appears, so get them very early in the spring, or in the fall when they often reappear.</field>
      <field name="cooking">I find this the most mild-tasting of all the mustards, good in salads, sandwiches, or cooked dishes that call for vegetables. They cook in 10 to 15 minutes. Include stronger-tasting vegetables, herbs, or spices, or your dish will taste too bland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In season in mid-spring, the flowers, flower buds, and the top parts of the stems that are tender enough to pinch off, taste like broccoli, excellent in salads (cooking would probably drown out the flavor), but small enough that it's hardly worth my while to harvest, although it would make an excellent garnish. Kids invariably love collecting and eating these parts, and rarely leave any unpicked, even if they hate broccoli!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seedpods are, in reality, as tasteless as my jokes- definitely not worth collecting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small, hairy root, albeit edible, also isn't worth the trouble to harvest and clean, much less chew!</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Shepherd's purse leaves provide vitamins A, C, K, B1, B2, B3, choline, and inositol, plus the minerals include calcium, potassium, and phosphorus. They also contain fumaric acid, which may inhibit cancer, especially if you're a lab mouse (it hasn't been tested in humans yet!)</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">An infusion of the above-ground parts contains saponins, choline, acetylcholine, and tyramine. It's supposed to be astringent, anti-inflammatory, and diuretic, as well as hemostatic, but when I tried it on a paper cut, it had no effect on the bleeding, and didn't make me run behind a bush either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used during or after childbirth and to ease difficult menstruation, it's also supposed to constrict the blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and contract the uterus, but I haven't seen any science either verifying or disproving these claims.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Because of its possible effects on the blood, this plant is contraindicated for pregnant women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid all contact with the tiny, sticky seeds if you're a microscopic invertebrate. You'll get stuck to them, and be absorbed by the carnivorous plant embryo!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">The common dandelion, wild lettuce, and chicory, all edible, have similar basal leaves, but the first 2 don't have lobes that point outward consistently, all 3 have white, milky sap, which shepherd's purse lacks, and the flowers and seeds are all very different from shepherd's purse's. Furthermore, chicory leaves usually have some red discoloration, plus some hairs on the underside of the leaf's midrib.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor man's pepper and its relatives the peppergrasses (&lt;i&gt;Lepidium spp.&lt;/i&gt;), all edible, have basal leaves with no colored sap too, but their leaves are aren't lobed and blunt. The seeds are never heart-shaped or triangular. The teeth of poor man's pepper, for example, point toward the leaf's base, and it seeds are circular. The seeds of field pennycress are circular and notched, and the seedpods of field pepper grass (&lt;i&gt;Lepidium campestre&lt;/i&gt;) are circular but not notched.</field>

      <field name="habitat">Gardens, lawns, meadows, fields, parks, damp woodland openings, trail edges, near riverbanks, and along roadsides.</field>

      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for dense stands of odorless, heart-shaped, shallow-toothed leaves, each arising from the ground on its own slender, hairless leaf stalk. In mid-spring, look for the addition of bilaterally symmetrical, medium-sized violet flowers with five petals—the lower three deeply veined, the side two bearded deep inside the flower.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This common, widespread, colonial plant’s only leaves are basal. Odorless, heart-shaped, hairless, shallow-toothed, they grow three to five inches long and as wide as they're long. Tightly curled at first, each leaf grows on top of a single, slender, hairless leafstalk three to eight inches high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barely taller than the leaves, each bilaterally symmetrical, scentless, violet-colored flower also arises from the ground on its own slender, hairless flower stalk. Of the five rounded petals, the two side ones are bearded with bushy stamens near the flower's throat, the three lower ones are deeply veined, and the lowest is slightly spurred. Hundreds of these colorful flowers, 0.75 to one inch across, fill meadows in mid-spring, arising from the branched rhizomes about 0.5 inches thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These showy springtime flowers are sterile, but in the fall, the fertile flowers—inconspicuous oblong, beige capsules about 0.5 inch long, hide at ground level. They self-fertilize, mature, and split lengthwise into three long, narrow troughs, to release a few dozen tiny, spherical seeds that look like ant eggs, translucent white at first, then dark brown when mature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="positiveId">• Heart-shaped, shallow-toothed leaves three to five inches long and wide&lt;br /&gt;• Each leaf arising from the ground on its own leaf stalk&lt;br /&gt;•Bilaterally symmetrical, medium-sized five-petaled, violet flowers&lt;br /&gt;•Each flower arising from the ground on its own flower stalk&lt;br /&gt;•Prominent veins on the three lower petals&lt;br /&gt;•Side petals bearded, deep inside the flower&lt;br /&gt;•Small spur at the base of the lower petal&lt;br /&gt;•Inconspicuous light brown flowers and fruits 0.5 inch long capsules, hidden at ground level&lt;br /&gt;•Fruit capsule splitting into three long, narrow troughs containing tiny, spherical, dark brown seeds&lt;br /&gt;•Entire plant odorless</field>
      <field name="harvesting">In early- and mid-spring, hold down handfuls of plants with one hand, and pull off as many leaves and violet flowers as possible, with as little of the tougher flower and leaf stalks as possible. Other parts of the plant are not edible.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Violets have a mild, subtle, but quite enjoyable flavor—somewhat bland at first, but with a surprise bite as part of the aftertaste. They're excellent raw, in salads and sandwiches, and they're great as cooked greens, steamed and served with olive oil, salt, and pepper, or in any vegetable dish that calls for cooked greens. They make an excellent replacement for spinach, for example, and cook in about 10 minutes.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">The leaves provide vitamin A and C, the flowers vitamin C.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Not much used by herbalists nowadays, a poultice of the leaves has been applied externally to relieve headaches and for boils, and an infusion of the leaves and flowers has been used for dysentery, constipation, coughs and colds, although I'm very skeptical about any of these uses actually working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, violets leaves contain genistein (also present in red clover), and isoflavone (a plant estrogen and anti-oxidant) that may lower the risk of cancer. Laboratory research shows that genistein alters the action of the genes that prostate cancer cells use to spread throughout the body, and research is underway to determine whether taking genistein benefits prostate cancer patients.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">Eat only the young leaves in the spring or fall, and the violet flowers that bloom in the spring. Don't eat the rhizomes, which may cause nausea and vomiting, or the inconspicuous ground level fall flower, fruit, or seeds.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">There are close to 80 similar edible violet-colored violet species in the US, and even the common blue violet is now considered a subspecies of a highly variable species that includes, among others, a subspecies with a white flower (&lt;i&gt;V. sororia albiflora&lt;/i&gt;), and a very common hybrid of that subspecies with the blue form that results in a blue-and-white flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that's not enough of a &lt;i&gt;confusing factor&lt;/i&gt; for you, I don't know what is. My preference is to enjoy these violets and let the botanists who are paid to do so work out the differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young garlic mustard's (&lt;i&gt;Alliaria petiolata&lt;/i&gt;) edible leaves resemble violets', but they're rounded, not pointed. Unlike violets, they grow in a basal rosette before a tall stem with white, four-petaled flowers appear; their leaf margins are wavy, they're very deeply veined, and they smell like garlic when crushed.</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Avoid violet species with yellow flowers, which may cause nausea and vomiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t confuse the common blue violet with the poisonous larkspur (&lt;i&gt;Delphinium tricorne&lt;/i&gt;), with a large, erect spur behind its violet colored, five-petaled flower, and leaves different from the violet's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poisonous monk’s hood (&lt;i&gt;Aconitum uncinatum&lt;/i&gt;) also has a violet flower, different leaves, and an upper sepal covers two of its petals like a helmet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t eat the African violet (&lt;i&gt;Saintpaulia spp.&lt;/i&gt;), a poisonous house plant that’s not a violet at all.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Wild carrots are good to eat in early spring, before the stored food gets dispersed into the above-ground parts, and then again in the fall, when food is again stored underground. You can also locate and dig up the roots during the winter in warm regions where the rosettes hang on and the ground doesn't freeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first began to forage, it seemed that the taproots were way to small to be worth harvesting. Then, after a few years, I discovered that they're quite large in sunny, sandy fields without grass competing for nutrients i.e., near the seashore. Not living in farm country, it only took me only another 28 years to learn that the roots also get very large in pastures, due to the fertilizing effect of the manure, and that's no BS (or maybe it is!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild carrots are very easy to dig up with a shovel, especially where the soil is sandy or moist and there aren't many rocks. A trowel also also works. And in particularly sandy fields, like those near the seashore, you can sometimes harvest wild carrots in quantity by gripping the top of the taproot under the rosette firmly with two hands and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Break off the seed heads while the seeds are still somewhat green and use them fresh or dried.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Wild carrots are stronger-tasting than commercial carrots, though not as sweet. There's more carrot and less water, so they don't make much juice when put through a juicer, and they're somewhat tough in salads, but they're superb grated or sliced thinly and cooked, where they retain their texture and don't get mushy the way commercial carrots do. Use them in soups, stews, casseroles, carrot cakes, carrot puddings, and carrot cookies. They cook in 15 to 20 minutes, and they're way better than their wimpy domesticated descendants in such recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the flowers and very young leaves are edible, they're somewhat bitter and not worth using, although some people do. The green or slightly brown seeds, on the other hand, make an excellent seasoning, similar to caraway and celery seeds. Use them fresh or dried, finely chopped or ground, in soups, stews, casseroles, or breads. They're exceptionally strong-flavored, so I usually use only one part wild carrot seeds in place of eight parts caraway or celery seeds!</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Except for beta-carotene, present in commercial carrots but absent in wild carrots, which aren't orange, the nutrients in the two related subspecies include vitamins C, D, E, K, B1 and B6, as well as biotin, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, organic sodium and some trace minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to research by Dr. Jim Duke (he's great—Google him and attend his tours if you ever get the opportunity), wild carrots provide acetone, acetyl-choline, alpha-linolenic-acid, alpha-pinene, alpha-tocopherol, apigenin, arachidonic-acid, arginine, asarone, ascorbic-acid, bergapten, beta-sitosterol, caffeic-acid, camphor, chlorogenic-acid, chlorophyll, chrysin, citral, citric-acid, coumarin, elemicin, esculetin, ethanol, eugenol, falcarinol, ferulic-acid, folacin, formic-acid, fructose, gamma-linolenic-acid, geraniol, glutamine, glycine, hcn, histidine, kaempferol, lecithin, limonene, linoleic-acid, lithium, lupeol, lutein, luteolin, lycopene, magnesium, manganese, methionine, mufa, myrcene, myricetin, myristicin, niacin, oleic-acid, pantothenic-acid, pectin, phenylalanine, potassium, psoralen, quercetin, scopoletin, stigmasterol, sucrose, terpinen-4-ol, thiamin, tryptophan, tyrosine, umbelliferone, xanthotoxin, and a slew of other vitamins and minerals.

      <field name="howToSpot">In early spring, look for basal rosettes with shallow-toothed leaves that become deeply lobed, with a few hairs on the leaves' midribs' undersides, no prickles, and no woody remnants of a previous year's flower stalks connected to the rosettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In mid-spring, look for an unbranched stem with deeply lobed, alternate, stalkless leaves except for near the top, where the leaves are barely toothed and clasp the stem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer and fall, look for small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers on long, slender branches, as well as small, white, dandelion-like seed heads with small achenes sticking together.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This native annual or biennial looks completely different from commercial lettuce, but it's a close relative, and quite good if you get it when it's very young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basal leaves, five to ten inches long, usually wider at the base than at the tip, are bluntly lobed at first, then become deeply toothed. The leaf midrib is triangular in cross-section, and its underside has at least some fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By mid-spring of its second year, or later in the first year if conditions are optimal, a stout, smooth, blue-green tinged, unbranched stem grows from four to ten feet tall. The stalkless, toothed, alternate leaves get ten inches long and three inches wide, sometimes with small, widely spaced teeth. The larger ones are deeply lobed, while the smaller upper ones have no lobes or shallow ones. Those near the top clasp the stem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pale yellow, sometimes orange-tinged, odorless, dandelion-like flower heads, 0.25 to 0.33 inch across, arise from slender, branching stalks toward the plant's top. Blooming from early summer to fall, they produce puffy, white, dandelion-like seed heads, again smaller than the dandelion's, often while some of the branches are still have buds or flowers. Attached to each other by slender beaks, the tiny, hard, dark brown achenes use tufts of white hairs for dispersion by the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The root is a thick taproot. When cut, the whole plant exudes a white, milky, bitter sap that turns brown when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•A basal rosette of lobed or toothed leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Some fine hairs on the underside of the leaf's midrib&lt;br /&gt;•Leaf midrib triangular in cross section&lt;br /&gt;•Deep, thick taproot&lt;br /&gt;•White, milky sap throughout the plant, drying brown&lt;br /&gt;•Stout, unbranched stem four to ten feet tall, beginning in mid-spring&lt;br /&gt;•Stalkless, toothed, alternate leaves on the stem up to ten inches long and three inches wide, sometimes with small, widely spaced teeth&lt;br /&gt;•Upper leaves clasping the stem&lt;br /&gt;•Larger stem leaves deeply lobed, smaller ones with shallow lobes or none</field>
      <field name="harvesting">The very young basal leaves are good in very early spring, before they develop lobes and become very bitter. While you can certainly grab handfuls of these leaves, cutting the root just under the center of the rosette with a pocket knife gets you the entire rosette in a second, and while it's still intact, you can shake off most of the debris before bagging the plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tender upper part of the flower stalk and accompanying small, young leaves you find in mid-spring, before the flowers appear, are also quite good. Cut them with a pocket knife, clippers or scissors, or just break them off with your hands.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Wild lettuce's basal leaves taste like commercial lettuce, only stronger, with only a slightly bitter aftertaste if you harvest it early enough. The immature tops of the flower stalks and the youngest top leaves are just as good before the plant begins to flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use wild lettuce sparingly in salads or sandwiches, or sauté it with herbs or spices before simmering it another 10 t0 15 minutes in a liquid, i.e., a sauce, soup, or stew, to counteract the concentration of bitterness that would otherwise occur as the leaves shrink.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Wild lettuce provides vitamins A, B1, B2, and C, plus potassium, phosphorus, calcium, iron, manganese, copper, zinc, and sodium.</field>

Prickly lettuce (&lt;i&gt;L. scariola&lt;/i&gt;) has bluish-tinged leaves with stout spines on the underside of the leaf's midrib, which you have to cut off with scissors before eating (the leaves, not the spines!) And, to no one’s surprise, hairy lettuce (&lt;i&gt;L. hirsuta&lt;/i&gt;) is unpleasantly hairy (as well as very bitter.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The common dandelion's edible leaves' deep teeth point toward the leaves bases, it's hairless, and always remains a basal rosette. Chicory, also edible, has deeply lobed leaves, often reddish-tinged, without a midrib that's triangular in cross section. Its basal rosettes grow among the remains of this perennial's previous year's woody flower stalks. And sow thistle (&lt;i&gt;Sonchus spp.&lt;/i&gt;), edible as well, is prickly.</field>

Then see if the leaves are toothed, oval to lance-shaped and hairless, and short-stalked or stalkless. See if the flowers grow in tufts from the leaf axils on terminal clusters, if they have protruding stamens, and whether they're white, pale violet, or pink-purple.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Mints are among the easiest plants to recognize. They all have opposite leaves, plus a square stem you can feel when you twirl it in your fingers. And edible mints smell like mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing 10 to 20 inches tall with a branched, purple-tinged stem, this spearmint spreads with branching rhizomes. It’s pointed (hence the &lt;i&gt;spear&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;spearmint&lt;/i&gt;), toothed, oval to lance-shaped, nearly hairless, stalkless or short-stalked, deeply-veined leaves grow up to three inches or more long, and up to one inch wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing in tufts from the leaf axils, along the top of the stem in terminal spikes, many white, pale violet, or purple-pink, bilaterally symmetrical, five-lobed flowers, with protruding stamens (&lt;i&gt;spicata&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;furnish with spikes&lt;/i&gt;) bloom from late spring through mid-fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fruit is a small, inconspicuous, dry capsule containing one to four seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Cut or break off all above-ground parts for tea, or strip the leaves and tops with your fingers for food use, leaving as much of the hard stems as possible behind.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Use any or all of the above-ground parts for making tea. For cooking, use the leaves, which don't have hard parts, finely chopped (or whole, as a garnish). They're great in virtually any dessert or sweet recipe, i.e.,  pies, cakes, sauces, puddings, ice cream, jello, breakfast cereals, and many more.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Spearmint provides vitamins A, B1, B2. B3. beta-carotene,  and other related antioxidant carotenoids (vitamin A precursors), the flavonoid hesperidin, and tryptophan, along with calcium, phosphorus, and iron.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Spearmint contains the essential oil menthol, and other biologically active compounds and antioxidants such as 1,8-cineole, acetic-acid, acetophenone, alpha-pinene, alpha-terpineol, apigenin, arginine, benzaldehyde, benzyl-alcohol, beta-sitosterol, borneol, carvacrol, carvone, caryophyllene, diosmin, ethanol, eugenol, farnesol, geraniol, limonene, luteolin, methionine, oleanolic-acid, perillyl-alcohol, pulegone, rosmarinic-acid, terpinen-4-ol, thymol, ursolic-acid,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An infusion of the above-ground parts of the plant does a great job settling upset stomachs and improving digestion. It's also used for morning sickness and motion sickness. It's been used for children’s digestive disorders, including colic, for centuries, whereas stronger peppermint has been preferred for adult indigestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Containing antimicrobial compounds, it's also used for colds, influenza, and fever, as well as for nervous headaches. Research even shows that it's good for mild hirsutism (excessive hairiness) in women because it reduces androgen levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spearmint is a mild diuretic. This is one I definitely avoid before leading foraging tours. If I have to duck behind the bushes, 20 people run after me, to see what I'm going to find! Nevertheless, a strong cup of hot tea will promote the flow of urine and relieve swelling due to water retention (of course, if the water retention is due to heart or kidney failure, you better get a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment before you cure the the symptoms, and drop dead.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macerated spearmint stems are also good as a poultice on bruises. Mixing them with burdock leaves, water, and clay may be even more effective.</field>

      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Europe, West Asia, and Northern Africa</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for bunches of narrow, cylindrical, erect basal leaves, sometimes floppy on top, in early spring and fall (and through mild spells during the winter). A spherical seed cluster sits on top of a tall, leafless stem in early summer. Check for onion/garlic like bulbs underground, and crush any part of the plant to detect the garlicky odor.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This is a delicious, common, widespread member of the onion/garlic family that smells like what you'd expect from such foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By mid-spring, field garlic produces long, slender, unbranched, hollow, round, grooved basal leaves 0.5 to two feet tall. They emerge from layered, underground bulbs resembling tiny onions. It's easy to distinguish field garlic from the surrounding grass once you start looking for bunches of cylindrical leaves growing among grass's flat blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The layered underground bulbs, growing to nearly one inch wide, look like small onions in the fall, winter, and early spring, but by mid-spring, smaller bulbs, resembling garlic cloves, partially split off to become new plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In late spring, a spherical cluster 0.75 to two inches wide, consisting of stalkless, whitish, green-tinged to reddish bulblets grows on the top of a single, long, slender, erect, smooth, leafless stem one to 3.5 feet tall. Each ovoid bulblet, with a flat side and a curved side, projects a tiny, slender, green shoot upward. Sometimes additional stalks about 0.75 inch long, with tiny, lilac-colored, six-petaled, short-stalked flowers, arise from the bulblets. Later on, a membrane surrounding the bulblets ruptures, and they fall to the ground to become new plants.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Bunches of tightly packed, long, narrow, cylindrical basal leaves&lt;br /&gt;•A long, slender, leafless stem&lt;br /&gt;•Spherical cluster of green, white, or pink bulblets on top of the stem&lt;br /&gt;•Ovoid bulblets flat on one surface, curved on the other&lt;br /&gt;•Tiny, slender green shoots often emerging from the tops of the young bulblets&lt;br /&gt;•Tiny, lilac-colored, six-parted flowers sometimes growing from the tops of the young bulblets&lt;br /&gt;•Small, onion- or garlic-like bulbs underground&lt;br /&gt;•Distinct garlicky odor when any part of the plant is torn or crushed</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Simply break or tear off the tender, young basal leaves in early spring and fall, and in the winter when the weather is mild, if the leaves aren't so badly damaged by the cold that there are too many yellow parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove the young, spherical clusters of terminal bulblets along with any accompanying tiny shoots or flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can dig up the bulbs with a shovel or trowel, although they sometimes come up when you pull out all the basal leaves at once. Swing them against a tree to separate some of the soil. Divide the bunch of leaves in half, then swing them against a tree again. Repeat until you're rid of most of the soil.</field>
      <field name="cooking">It's amazing how much you can find on and offline about how tough, stringy, and awful this plant is. Apparently none of these writers goes out to forage in very early spring, or even autumn (they certainly don't know there's a second season), when the leaves are young, tender, and delicious. Use these tender, young leaves raw or cooked like scallions or chives when they first come up in early spring or fall, not when they really are tough and coarse, in mid-spring. They cook in about 15 minutes, and taste like an exotic combination of onions, garlic, and chives. For onion/garlic aficionados on my early spring or autumn tours who never heard of this plant before, it's always love at first bite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small underground bulbs taste like onions in seasons when the weather is cold, then become spicier, like garlic, when the weather gets warmer. Use them accordingly, raw or cooked. They cook in about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The terminal bulblets are quite spicy, like garlic. Use them while they're still young, before the skin gets tough, like you use garlic.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Little information is available about the nutrient content of this plant, but field garlic contains strong anti-oxidative properties due to its high concentration of flavonoids, carotenoids and chlorophyll, and members of this genus are generally healthful to eat. They contain sulfur compounds that help reduce bad cholesterol levels and promote good digestion, and they may act as tonics for the circulatory system.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Field garlic is considered a blood purifier, carminative, diuretic, expectorant, stimulant, and vasodilator. The raw bulbs can lower blood pressure, which makes this a good candidate for treating high blood pressure, as long as the condition is medically monitored in case of fluctuations either way. And a tincture has been used to prevent children from getting colic and croup. The whole plant has been shown to have anti-asthmatic properties, a good food for people with this condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Field garlic is also supposed to prevent kids from getting worms, but this definitely doesn't work. Whenever my 6-year-old daughter, Violet, who loves field garlic, finds a worm while she's digging up the bulbs on one of my tours, the plant never prevents her from getting the worm, and keeps it to play with until she lets it go at the end of the tour!</field>

      <field name="cautions">1. Avoid this plant if you suffer from low blood pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Don't let your cow eat the plant, lest it flavor her milk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.

        <field name="title">1)Sourdough Starter for Dummies</field>
        <field name="slug">1sourdough-starter-for-dummies</field>

        <field name="directions">Sourdough Starter for Dummies from &lt;i&gt;The Wild Vegan Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;, by "Wildman" Steve Brill&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early 1980s I was introduced to a naturally fermented health drink called rejuvelac in a course taught by Steve Meyerowitz, the Sproutman. Simple to make, this fermented health drink also provides a foolproof starting point for inaugurating a sourdough starter that yields wonderfully tangy sourdough breads, pancakes, and muffins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you experience genuine wild sourdough baked goods, you'll never even think of using commercial starter again. You'll want to maintain your starter forever, and you may even give some away as a gift to grateful culinary friends. Here's everything you need to know about creating, using, and maintaining a wild yeast starter. The steps are many, but each one is very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never use up all of your starter. Use some for your recipes, and add more rye or some other whole-grain flour and water to the remainder to replenish it. If you use the starter daily, store it at room temperature, beat it twice a day (I know this sounds cruel), and replenish it as necessary. If you use your starter less frequently, store it in the refrigerator, beat it every few days to keep the flour and water from separating, and feed it with additional flour and water once a week to keep it from starving to death (now that would really be cruel). 6 to 12 hours before you plan on using your starter again, feed it, add enough water to restore it to a thick batter, beat it, and let it stand at room temperature. You can use it again as soon as it bubbles actively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To turn a normal yeast bread recipe into a sourdough recipe, replace the dry yeast required for 2 medium-size loaves with 1 cup starter and omit 1/2 cup of the flour and 1/2 cup of the water from the recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup wheat berries (available in health food stores)&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup water, plus more as needed&lt;br /&gt;1 cup rye flour (or half as much rye flour as the amount of starter you want to make)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. In a small bowl, soak the wheat berries in the 1/2 cup water overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Drain the wheat berries and then tie them in a mesh bag, cheesecloth, nylon stocking (a clean one!), or any other porous cloth container and hang the sprout sack where it can drain at room temperature. Rinse the bag with water twice a day for about 3 days, until the sprouts on the wheat berries are as long as the wheat berry itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Put the sprouts in a blender with twice their volume of water and blend on the lowest speed for a few seconds, just to break up the sprouts. Don't overblend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Put the sprout-water combination in a non-metal (glass, plastic, or ceramic--metal kills wild yeast) jar or food container and cover the container with cheesecloth or a towel (it should not be airtight). Let the mixture sit at room temperature for about 3 days, stirring it twice a day with a non-metal implement, until the liquid bubbles and tastes sour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Strain out and discard the sprouts. The liquid is now called rejuvelac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Using a non-metal implement, stir in the rye flour and enough additional water to make a thick batter. Something close to an equal volume of liquid to flour usually does the trick. Cover the starter loosely, let it sit at room temperature, and stir it twice a day. When it bubbles actively, it's ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: Don't fill your starter container to the top when storing it. The starter may expand, pop the lid, and make a mess.</field>

      <field name="cooking">Chefs and foragers praise the ramp as the acme of wild onions, but this lesser-known plant is just as good. Way tastier than any commercial onion, the flavor is part-way between that of onions and garlic. Use the leaves, bulbs, flowers, and bulblets the way you'd use onions, garlic scapes, scallions, or chives, in any type of savory recipe, using any cooking method. They cook in about 10 minutes. </field>
      <field name="nutrition">There's no nutritional analysis available, although it's likely that this plant is packed with nutrients, like the other &lt;i&gt;Alliums&lt;/i&gt; in this app. And since Lewis and Clark staved off both starvation and scurvy in the winter by eating this plant's bulblets, it must be a good source of vitamin C.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Like its wild and commercial relatives, this plant is considered anti-asthmatic, carminative, diuretic, expectorant, and a stimulant. A tincture has been used for worms, colic, and croup in children, while its sulfur-containing amino acids may reduce bad cholesterol levels, tonify the cariovascular system, and aid digestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Native Americans and pioneers applied the juice of the plant to burns, and various Native American tribes used crushed bulbs to treat boils, bee stings, and snakebites. They also used this plant for fevers, skin problems, hemorrhoids, earaches, rheumatism and arthritis, tapeworms and other internal parasites, blood disorders, and lung problems. These uses should be tested, although I'm not going to volunteer to be bitten by a snake!&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">Avoid this plant if you suffer from low blood pressure. It could aggravate the condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considered a noxious weed in some Deep South states, where it gives milk a garlicky flavor if cows eat it, it's a threatened or endangered species in some of the northernmost states in the East. Please don't collect it in Maine, New Hampshire, or Vermont. There are plenty of other edibles that are very common.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Other edible &lt;i&gt;Alliums&lt;/i&gt; look and smell similar to wild garlic, but none has fibers surrounding the bulb. Field garlic, for example, has flat, hollow basal leaves and a leafless flower stalk, while nodding onion has a floppy flower- and seed head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daylily shoots, also edible, have flat, narrow leaves branching from near the base, but the young leaves aren't floppy, the plant has rhizomes and tubers underground instead of bulbs, and there's no odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People sometimes confuse this plant with grass, but grass has thin blades, no bulbs, and it smells like grass!</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">This spicy-tasting plant grows a basal rosette configured like a cone, with long, narrow, smooth, linear, outward-drooping basal leaves one foot long and 0.25 inch across. A shallow groove runs down each leaf's length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A slender, leafless stem up to 1.5 feet tall (sometimes taller) bends over on top, like a shepherd's crook, and produces a flower head at its tip with six-tepaled white, lavender, or pink, bell-like flowers, 0.25 inch long, all spread out into a loose circle, hanging umbrella-fashion (so only bees, which don't mind being upside-down, can pollinate them), by slender, smooth, spoke-like flower stalks 0.75 inch long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike its relatives, no bulblets grow on top. Blooming in mid-summer, the flowers are soon replaced by seed capsules containing small, flat black seeds light enough to be spread by the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The underground bulb, longer than it's wide, subdivides into new bulbs, creating bunches of plants.

      <field name="nutrition"></field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">This plant probably has properties similar to garlic, but should be tested. The Native Americans used the juice of the plant for hives, croup, colds and sore throat. The applied a poultice of the whole plant externally for pleurisy, croup, infections, sores, and swellings, and used a warm poultice of the bulbs for sore throat.</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">This common mint's round to kidney-shaped, scallop-edged, opposite, stalked leaves, often tinged with purple, and with hairs on the upper surface, grow 0.5 to 2.5 inches across. The hairy leafstalks are longer than the leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opposite clusters of small, two-lipped, funnel shaped, bilaterally symmetrical, purple-blue or bluish-violet to lavender flowers bloom in the leaf axils, usually in groups of two or three, from early spring through early summer. The five-lobed, purple-spotted flowers have fine, whitish hairs inside. Each flower may produce up to four tiny, oval, brown nutlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ground ivy spreads using runners, resulting in dense mats all of one inch high, although the plant sometimes grows upright and reaches a height of about eight inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When crushed, the whole plant smells musty, like mint with a hint of motor oil. </field>

      <field name="harvesting">Simply strip off leaves and flowers with your fingers if you're going to eat the plant, and include the stems if you're going to make tea.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Although the young leaves are edible, they're  not very tasty, somewhat bitter and with overtones of mint and balsam. While people sometimes include them in salads or add them to soups, they're best used in tea, especially with other herbs. Lemon verbena (&lt;i&gt;Aloysia triphylla&lt;/i&gt;), which doesn't grow wild in the US, is the traditional companion herb.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Ground ivy is a good source of vitamin C, iron, and antioxidants.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">An infusion has been used as a general tonic, for colds and coughs, and to relieve congested mucous membranes, for centuries. This has been upheld by science, which has demonstrated it to have antibiotic and anti-inflammatory effects in lab animals. And it's definitely a diuretic. I once embarked on a five mile bicycle ride after sharing a cup of ground ivy tea with a friend. I had to make five pit stops, and there were no pits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A poultice of bruised fresh leaves was applied to wounds and sores, and an infusion of the leaves, flowers, and stems has been used for jaundice, poisoning, sciatica, gout, tinnitus, catarrh, diarrhea, bile disorders, hemorrhoids, lead poisoning, and tuberculosis, and even the plague. Its efficacy here is uncertain, but a if it doesn't work and you die of all these maladies, don't worry—the plant can still help you—the English make a wreath from the stems and leaves for the dead!</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">1. This plant can poison you, but only if you're a horse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It does contain terpenoids and terpene-rich volatile oils that could irritate the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys of humans, so start with small quantities of this plant to be sure you don't get any adverse reactions.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Here's another example of a common name causing confusion. This plant is a mint, unrelated to ivies (&lt;i&gt;Hedera spp.&lt;/i&gt;). Other mints (&lt;i&gt;Mentha spp.&lt;/i&gt;) may superficially resemble ground ivy, but most don't have creeping stems that root at the nodes. Henbit (&lt;i&gt;Lamium amplexicaule&lt;/i&gt;) does, but it has no leaf stalks rather than long ones, and the flower are bright pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ground ivy leaves look like those of common mallow, also edible, but mallow leaves are hairless and odorless, and the stem is round, not square.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People sometimes confuse ground ivy leaves with those of garlic mustard. However, garlic mustard's hairless leaves are much larger, they grow in basal rosettes, not trailing the ground, and they smell like garlic, not mint.</field>

      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">Leaves: Available when few wild foods are around, they're at their best during warm spells in the winter, in the earliest spring, and late in the fall, when they first come up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flower buds and flowers: Early to mid-spring</field>
      <field name="habitat"> Sunny or lightly shaded, moist fields, disturbed sites, marshes, vacant lots, roadsides, and ditches</field>
      <field name="range">Throughout most of the US  and southern Canada, except for Mississippi Louisiana, Texas, Utah, and Nevada</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Europe</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for plants with shiny, dark green basal leaves with several smaller lobes and one large terminal lobe growing in a basal rosette in cold weather seasons. In the spring, look for shiny, alternate, hairless leaves, lobed toward the bottom of a top-branching flower stalk, and smaller with fewer or no lobes on top. Look for terminal culsters of bright yellow four-petaled flowers, 0.33 inches across, followed by long, slender seed pods.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo"> This common mustard's glossy, dark green, toothless, hairless, deeply lobed basal leaves first appear in late winter. Two to eight inches long, they have one to four paired lobes and a larger, heart-shaped terminal lobe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By mid-spring (during the second year for those plants that are biennial instead of annual), a hairless, ridged, purple-tinged stem, branching toward the top, reaches one to three feet in height. Its long, broad, wavy edged or toothed, stalkless lower alternate leaves have four to eight paired lobes, while the progressively smaller upper leaves have fewer lobes, until the ones near the top, which clasp the stem, are shaped like duck's feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small, stalked flower buds, which grow on terminal clusters toward the top of the plant, resemble tiny heads of broccoli. They open into long clusters of small, four-petaled, bright yellow, stalked flowers, which in turn mature into tough, narrow, slender, unlobed seed pods, called silques, up to one inch long. These grow below the flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roots are fibrous.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•A basal rosette of glossy, hairless, leaves with opposite lobes and a larger, heart-shaped terminal lobe&lt;br /&gt;•A ridged, purple-tinged stem, branching near the top&lt;br /&gt;•Hairless, alternate stem leaves, lobed near the bottom, and smaller leaves with fewer or no lobes, clasping the stem, toward the top&lt;br /&gt;•Small, broccoli-like flower buds, followed by terminal clusters of bright yellow four-petaled flowers 0.33 inches across toward the top of the plant&lt;br /&gt;•Slender seed pods 0.33 inch long on terminal clusters, growing below the flowers</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Although you may certainly tear off the basal leaves with your fingers, it's much more effective to sweep a pocket knife under the rosette to sever the root and gain the entire rosette. Then you can shake off the debris and bag it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluck off the flower buds or flowers with your fingers.</field>
      <field name="cooking">This is nearly everyone's least favorite wild food, with leaves and the tender tops of the stems tasting like bitter cabbage, although about one of out 10 people say they like this plant (I don't know whether to believe them.) Only once, during a tour of Central Park, did we find the leaves when they must have just come up a few days earlier, and everyone was surprised by how good they tasted, very much like arugula. It took only 27 years of foraging tours to find them in this state, and it might take another 27 years before this ever happens again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the flower buds like broccoli, but they're so small, it may not be worth the effort. You can also add the flowers to salads or cooked vegetable dishes. They're spicy but also bitter, so use them sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have boiled the leaves in repeated changes of water to get rid of the bitterness, but this also destroys the nutrients. I've had success pickling them with Korean spices and making kimchi. I've also dehydrated them, ground it into powder in a blender, mixed this with buckwheat flour, olive oil, salt, and water, and rolled this out into very tasty pasta with a pasta machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding small amounts of very young leaves to a salad that contains sweet ingredients, i.e., grapes or raisins, also works, and you could try saut&amp;#233e;ing the leaves in oil with lots of spices, then simmering them in a sauce, which works for some bitter greens.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Winter cress leaves provide generous amounts of vitamins A, B1, B2, C, and E, as well as iron, manganese, and calcium. The flower buds are rich in protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leaves are also a good source of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC). In combination with curcumin, which is found in the herb turmeric (&lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt;), it’s been demonstrated to prevent prostate cancer and slow its progression in mice .This may or may not prove effective in humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">The leaves are considered a vulnerary, and have been used in poultices on open wounds, bee stings and other skin ailments. An infusion of the tea is supposed to be a diuretic, and the Mohegan Indians used this infusion for coughs. I don't know how well it works.  </field>

I only got to try it once, and it's very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild mustard (&lt;i&gt;Brassica kaber&lt;/i&gt;) and wild radish, both edible, look like winter cress. The former has hairy leaves, and the latter's leaves lack the large terminal lobe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People confuse winter cress with watercress, also edible, but the latter is a smaller plant with white, not yellow flowers, that grows in the water.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Strip off the tender, immature pods. Split mature pods open with your fingers and remove the peas, in the field or at home. Because they're so small, collecting is labor-intensive, but well worth it.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The immature pods taste like snow peas. If they're tender enough for your taste, add them to salads. Otherwise, they're excellent stir-fried in east Asian dishes, simmered in soups, or included in virtually any recipe that calls for cooked veggies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green peas taste like commercial peas, only better (but by the time they turn brown, they become about as edible as the pebbles they resemble). The big problem is their small size. Unless you have unlimited time and patience for collecting and shelling, you're best mixing some into a salad, using them as a garnish, or including them in virtually any vegetable dish as a minor ingredient (or try sprouting them). They cook in five to ten minutes.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Beach peas contain high concentrations of B-complex vitamins, beta-carotene, and protein, similar to commercial peas, but probably more concentrated.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Not used in traditional Western herbal medicine. I've heard mention of the leaves being used in traditional Chinese medicine, but haven't been able to learn any of the details.</field>

      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a medium-sized tree with smooth, silver-gray bark sometimes cracked, that doesn't peel, streaked with horizontal, whitish lines. Black Birch has alternate, double toothed, medium-sized, oval to elliptical leaves, pendant catkins, and short, stubby upright cones in early spring. Scratch and sniff for the fragrance of wintergreen.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This very tasty, medium-sized tree grows 50 to 80 feet tall, with a trunk up to 2.5 feet across, a rounded crown, and spreading branches. The shiny, smooth, non-peeling bark is marked with distinct, whitish horizontal lenticels. The bark, reddish-brown when young, silver-gray when mature, and dark gray when old. It doesn’t peel in younger trees, but develops irregular cracks as it ages, becoming furrowed and broken into shallow scales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spring, long, yellowish male catkins, two to three inches long, hang from the tips of the slender, reddish-brown, white-dotted twigs. Smaller, stubby, erect, greenish, female flowers, 0.5 to one inch long, grow behind them on same twig tips. Small upright cones, one inch to 1.5 inches long, persist from late summer to winter, with many tiny, hard, winged seeds inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, alternate, oval, double-toothed, pointy tipped leaves grow 2.5 to six inches long, with heart-shaped bases, a darker, shiny upper surface, and a paler underside. The leaves turn bright yellow in autumn.In the winter, slender, pointed, reddish-brown and greenish, alternate buds grow on the twigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole tree smells like wintergreen when injured.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•A medium-sized tree with smooth, non-peeling, silver-gray bark, sometimes cracked, marked by horizontal lines&lt;br /&gt;•Oil of wintergreen fragrance where injured&lt;br /&gt;•Alternate, double-toothed, oval to lance-shaped leaves 2.5 to 6 inches long&lt;br /&gt;•Long, yellowish male catkins, two to three inches, hanging from the tips of the twigs in early spring&lt;br /&gt;•Stubby, erect, greenish, female flowers, 0.5 to one inch long, growing behind the catkins&lt;br /&gt;•Small upright cones, one inch to 1.5 inches long, from summer into winter</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Break off the twigs any time of the year and use them fresh or dehydrated. If a tree has recently been felled by a storm, use a knife to collect the green cambium, the green layer of tissue between the bark and wood. But please don't go injuring healthy trees by stripping off the bark to collect the cambium, when the twigs are just as good!</field>
      <field name="cooking">Chew on the twigs in the field. They're delicious and refreshing. Steep them to make a tasty tea. Simmer agar (available in health food stores) in the water beforehand until dissolved, add a sweetener, plus additional sweet seasonings if desired, strain out the twigs, and chill. You'll have a unique black birch jello!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've harvested the cambium, you can eat it as is, or use it as a sweet seasoning, fresh or dried, chopped or ground.</field>
      <field name="nutrition"></field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">An infusion of black birch twigs or cambium contains oil of wintergreen, a.k.a. methyl salicylate, the chemical forerunner of aspirin and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, used by the Indians for pain and inflammation. You must drink many cups of a strong tea over a period of hours to achieve an effective dosage, but if you had had pain and inflammation before Bayer synthesized aspirin from the same chemical (originally extracted from white willow tree (&lt;i&gt;Salix alba&lt;/i&gt;)), this was the remedy of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low dose aspirin is prescribed for people with heart disease, to thin the blood and prevent clots in the coronary arteries causing heart attacks, but aspirin increases the risk of internal bleeds that could lead to gastrointestinal ulcers and strokes. It lowers your risk of death if you have heart disease, but give it to millions of healthy people, and the risk outweighs the benefit. A couple of cups of strong black birch tea a day could have the same protective effect, there's no documented evidence of side effects, and it tastes good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This low dose painkiller worked whenever my daughter, Violet, was teething, stopping the pain every time when she was too young for more concentrated pharmaceutical painkillers. I simply gave her the twigs to chew, and they're too large to swallow. I probably just rediscovered what the Native Americans must have been doing hundreds of years ago, and while I've found no documentation of this practice, they knew about this painkiller, and would have liked to quiet a crying baby as much as anyone else would!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chewing on the twigs also covers up the bad breath you get from eating wild or cultivated members of the onion family (&lt;i&gt;Allium spp.&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil of wintergreen, a concentrate you'd have to buy, is a traditional counter-irritant for arthritis and neuralgia, applied externally as a balm, liniment, or ointment. It's supposed to be an alternative, pain-killer, antiseptic,  deobstruent, purgative, diaphoretic, diuretic, parasiticide, pectoral, stomachic, and vulnerary, also used for burns, chafing, cholera, colds, cough, dandruff, diarrhea, dysentery,  painful menstruation, gout, gravel, lumbago, rheumatism, scalds, sciatica, sores, and more, but without supporting evidence. However, it's toxic when taken internally, or used excessively externally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black birch also contains betulin, which will lower your cholesterol levels, prevent obesity, improve your insulin sensitivity, and increase your resistance to developing atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries, but only if you're a lab mouse, so far.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Taken internally or applied excessively externally, oil of wintergreen (methyl salicylate), a concentrate you'd have to buy, is toxic, and has caused deaths, especially among children and especially sensitive individuals. In 1997, for example, a teenage track star died from using too much liniment containing this substance. If you have problems with aspirin, avoid this plant.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">The black cherry tree (&lt;i&gt;Prunus serotina&lt;/i&gt;) has similar bark, but way more cracks in larger trees, a bitter almond odor when injured (like that of the inside of an apricot or peach kernels), and different leaves, flowers, and fruit. Although the cambium contains a chemical precursor of cyanide, the poison, if formed, is destroyed by heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other birches (&lt;i&gt;Betula spp.&lt;/i&gt;) have lighter-colored barks that peel. Non-poisonous, they don't contain enough oil of wintergreen to make a tasty tea.</field>

      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a tall tree with deeply grooved bark, alternate, feather-compound leaves, paired oval to elliptical leaflets, a lone leading leaflet, pairs of angled spines sometimes growing at the leaf bases, and pendant clusters of showy, fragrant, white, bilaterally symmetrical flowers blooming in mid-spring.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This native Eastern tree provides sweet, vanilla-flavored blossoms in great quantity for a few weeks every spring. Growing from 40 to 100 feet tall and 12 to 30 inches in diameter, the deeply grooved, dark reddish-brown to brown or dark gray bark is composed of deeply furrowed flat ridges. Very young trees have smooth, brown bark, and lots of prickly spines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turning yellow-brown in autumn, the alternate, feather-compound leaves grow from six to 14 inches long, with seven to 21 oval to elliptical, toothless leaflets, each one to two inches long. Pairs of small, angled spines, much more common on younger trees than older ones, protect the leaf axils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In mid-spring, fragrant, white, bilateral-symmetrical flowers 0.75 to one inch across, grow in dense, showy, drooping terminal racemes four to eight inches long. Each flower hangs from a slender, reddish-brown or reddish green flower stalk half an inch long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ripening in autumn and persisting through the winter, short, flat, hairless, two-sided, black pods, growing from two to six inches long and 0.75 inch across, contain four to seven flat, hard, black, bean-like seeds under 0.25 inch across. They hang from the tree in such numbers that with very good imagination and very poor vision, they could resemble a swarm of roosting locusts.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Tall tree with feather-compound leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Paired oval to elliptical, smooth-edged, short-stalked leaflets, plus one lone leading leaflet&lt;br /&gt;•Paired prickles at the base of the leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Pendulous clusters of fragrant, bilaterally symmetrical, white, pea-like flowers&lt;br /&gt;•Thick, dark gray or dark brown, ropey bark&lt;br /&gt;•Persistent, small, short, flat, brown seedpods&lt;br /&gt;•Small, hard, flattened, black seeds</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Strip off and bag the flowers, which freeze well. You can also collect the mature seeds from the pods.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The flowers, with their strong, sweet, vanilla-like fragrance and flavor, are ideal for salads, ice cream, pies, fruit soups, fritters, pancakes, smoothies, and all variety of desserts. I've even made a delicious wine with them (that one's in my cookbook—plug, plug!). They're can be quite strong-flavored, so use them sparingly, and don't use them with vanilla, or the combined flavors become too intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could also try cooking the seeds like beans, but they're too small to be worthwhile and I never got around to trying them.</field>
      <field name="nutrition"></field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">The flowers are considered antispasmodic, aromatic, diuretic, and emollient, as well as laxative, but my tour participants and I have been enjoying them in quantity for years, and no one's ever starting running around the parks looking for mullein (&lt;i&gt;Verbascum thapsus&lt;/i&gt;) leaves to use as toilet paper, so all the medicinal claims could be wishful thinking. Nevertheless, the flowers contain do benzaldehyde, which may lower the risk of cancer in the low concentrations present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decoction made from the cambium was used as an emetic and purgative in the days of heroic herbalism, such harmful treatments aren't used anymore today.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Don't stand under this tall tree during a thunderstorm, when torrents of electrically-conductive rainwater flow down the trunk's deep grooves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many books claim the seeds are poisonous, but 1960s foraging guru Ewell Gibbons fed them to his family, so, while I haven't had the patience to collect enough of the tiny seeds to cook myself, I relegate the claims of toxicity to the spurious foraging phobias.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Break off the unopened fiddleheads. Avoid unfurled ones, which are poisonous, and take no more than half of each bunch, so you don't deplete the rhizomes' reserve food supply.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Sautée, steam, or simmer the fiddleheads in soups or stews. They cook in 10 minutes, and taste like a combination of asparagus and green beans. Season them lightly, and avoid using lots of strong-flavored ingredients, or you'll drown out the fiddleheads' delicate flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People from around the world also cook the rhizomes 10 to 15 minutes and separate the starch from the fiber. They also dry them, pound them with mallets, and sift out the starch to use as flour, or as a thickener. I never found bracken in enough quantity to dig them up without causing ecological harm, so I don't know how easy this is to do, but it looks like this kind of processing usually tends to be labor-intensive.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Bracken fiddleheads provide vitamins A and E, plus calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and iron.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Use only the unrolled fiddleheads, not the mature ferns, which are poisonous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The raw fiddleheads may cause gastric distress, and they contain thiamase, an enzyme that breaks down thiamine and can lead to beriberi if eaten in quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bracken has at least thee known carcinogens, and has been associated with stomach cancer in Japan, where it's canned and eaten year-around, so it's safer not to eat this seasonal plant regularly throughout the year if you chose to consume it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This plant is common in some places are rare in others. Please leave it alone where it's rare, and collect no more than half the fiddleheads from any one bunch, so the rhizome, which can't put up any new growth until the following spring, isn't starved to death. And certainly don't dig up the rhizomes unless the plant's very common, and then take only a small fraction of them.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Bracken fiddleheads are easy to distinguish from other unopened ferns because of the woolly, grayish-white color, and the lack of a scaly coverings or long hairs, and their three-parted talon-like configuration.</field>

      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a seriously spiny plant that begins as a basal rosette with very hairy, deeply lobed, lance-shaped basal leaves. Similarly stalkless, bull thistle has alternate stem leaves with leaf bases descending the stem pink to magenta flower heads that look like shaving brushes on ovate bases, and tiny seeds with tufts of white hairs.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This forbiddingly spiny, coarse, erect invasive Eurasian plant has both tasty roots and a delicious stem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plant begins with a basal rosette of very hairy, lance-shaped, feather-compound leaves up to 1.5 feet long, with spines at the midribs and tips of the lobes. Coarse hairs grow on the leaves' upper surfaces, while the undersides are wooly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stout, hairy, spiny stem that usually branches in the middle and grows from three to 12 feet tall arises in mid-spring of the second year, with similar alternate leaves. Lacking leaf stalks, the leaves' thorny bases descend the stem on prominent ridges, arming it with spiny "wings."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From late spring to early fall, terminal, pink to magenta, shaving brush-shaped flower heads both one to two inches long and wide, usually grow individually (sometimes in groups) above green, ovoid bases—each composed of fused, spine-tipped bracts. Many tiny, slender, tubular disk flowers, without ray flowers, comprise the composite flower head. The wind blows off the tiny straw-colored seeds, along with tufts of white hair, known as &lt;i&gt;thistledown&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several light brown, fleshy, branching taproots three to 12 inches long, grow underground.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Basal rosette consisting of long, lance-shaped, very hairy, spiny, feather-compound leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Long, sharp spines at the leaves' midribs and the tips of the leaves' lobes (and just about everywhere else!)&lt;br /&gt;•Leaves' upper surfaces coarsely hairy&lt;br /&gt;•Leaves' undersides wooly&lt;br /&gt;•Stout, prickly stems three to 12 feet tall, often branching&lt;br /&gt;•Long, alternate, lance-shaped, very hairy, spiny, feather-compound stem leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Stalkless leaves' thorny bases descending the stem on prominent ridges&lt;br /&gt;•Pink to magenta shaving brush-shaped flower heads, both one to two inches long and wide&lt;br /&gt;•Flower heads growing above ovoid, prickly, green bases&lt;br /&gt;•Flower heads composed of many tiny, slender, pink, tubular disk flowers&lt;br /&gt;•Seeds, tiny and straw-colored, attached to tufts of white hair&lt;br /&gt;•Light brown fleshy, branching taproots three to 12 inches long</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Always wear heavy duty work gloves when handling this plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Dig up the taproots of the basal rosette with a shovel or trowel. Choose a location where the plant is common, but rocks are not, and dig after it's rained when the soil is yielding, not during a drought. Use a knife to trim off the foliage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Before the stem is fully grown and while it still feels soft and flexible, long before the flowers develop, cut it off with a pocket knife, cut off and discard the leaves, and peel the stem to get rid of the prickles. This is easier to do in the field than bringing home bags full of large, bulky, prickly plants. </field>
      <field name="cooking">Use the peeled, immature stems like celery. It has a similar texture but tastes better than celery. It's excellent raw in salads and sandwiches, and you'll love it cooked 10 to 15 minutes in virtually any savory dish, using any cooking method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taproots taste like a combination of Jerusalem artichokes and parsnips. Slice them and cook 15 to 20 minutes in soups, stews, or casseroles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the young leaves are edible, you'd have to spend the rest of your life cutting off the prickles before you get to try them.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">While detailed information is lacking, the roots contain inulin, a sweet-tasting polysaccharide that doesn't cause a blood sugar spike, good for diabetes and hypogycemia, although it gives some people gas.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Not a major medicinal plant, people used both a poultice and decoction of the roots for sore jaws, and made an herbal steam of the whole plant for treating rheumatic joints. A decoction of the whole plant has also been used both internally and externally for bleeding piles. But since there's been no research on unfortunate rheumatic people with bleeding piles who were socked in the jaw, there's no telling whether or not it's effective.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Don't handle this plant without heavy duty work gloves. The spines are long and very sharp, and can even pierce such gloves, so handle with care.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Other non-poisonous thistles may resemble bull thistle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canada Thistle (&lt;i&gt;C. arvense&lt;/i&gt;) has similar flower head, but rhizomes rather than a taproots, and no basal rosettes. Since this invasive species provides no food, the only good thing to do with Canada thistle is send it back to Canada! And musk thistle (&lt;i&gt;Carduus nutans&lt;/i&gt;) looks similar, but its leaves usually lack hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sow thistles, which include the common sow thistle (&lt;i&gt;Sonchus oleraceus&lt;/i&gt;) are edible, but they aren't true thistles. However, they have bristles that don't hurt you, and white, milky sap, which true thistles lack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="howToSpot">Look for dense stands of tall freshwater wetland plants with narrow basal leaves only. The tight, cylindrical flower heads are first green, then covered with golden pollen, and finally with fluffy, white seeds that overwinter and persist into spring.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">One of the best plants for foragers of any level of knowledge, this tasty, abundant, widespread, easy-to-recognize wetland plant has several edible parts. Cattails grow in dense colonies, spreading from stout rhizomes usually 0.25 to 1.25 inches across, and up to 27 inches long, growing three to four inches beneath the mud or sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 12 to 16 erect, flat, linear, basal leaves grow from three to ten feet tall and 0.33 to 0.75 inches wide. With parallel veins and a spongy cross section, a clear, mucilaginous substance oozes from between the leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The erect, leafless stem grows from six to ten feet tall, 0.375 to 0.75 inches across, tapering toward the top. Male and female flowers grow on separate parts of an unjointed, terminal, cylindrical spike six inches long and one inch across, with the male always on top, befitting a very ancient plant that evolved before the sexual revolution! Green at first, the flower head’s mature male section becomes covered with golden pollen in late spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the male flower withers, the green female section turns brown in the summer, then becomes covered with fluffy, white seeds in late fall. The seed head persists into early spring, making it easy to differentiate a stand of cattails from other wetland plants.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">It's much easier to harvest any part of the cattail in periods of dry weather, when you can walk right up to the plants, rather than after lots of rain, when you have to walk through water or slog through mud, so try to plan your activities accordingly (or buy wading boots!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shoot: Before an individual stalk flowers, pull apart some of the outer leaves, grab the core, and pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Male (upper) immature green flower head: Clip with shears or heavy-duty scissors, or cut off with a knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pollen: After days without wind (which blows away the pollen), repeatedly bend mature flower heads over a paper bag and shake. Sift out the debris later. Or collect the immature male spikes and let them mature at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhizomes: Wrench the rhizomes, along with any small lateral shoots, out of the mud, and hose them down thoroughly to remove the mud. </field>
      <field name="cooking">Shoots: The peeled shoots are delicious, substantial, and easy to collect, especially as they get quite large before they flower (once they flower the shoots become incredibly tough), with a flavor of cucumber and zucchini. Use this very versatile food raw, or cook using virtually any cooking method, in any recipe that calls for vegetables. They cook in about 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immature green male flower heads: Steam, bake with seasoned oil, or boil 15 to 20 minutes—they're a little like corn-on-the-cob, but drier, so they're at their best served with a sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pollen: Sweet and tasty, use it to supplement whole-grain flour in breads, muffins, pancakes, waffles, or any baked goods. Lacking gluten, it won't help bread rise, so you can use it in recipes that call for flour that don't need to rise, or supplement non-gluten flours with ground flax seeds or chia seeds, plus guar or xanthan gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhizomes: This is an impractical wild food. Wrenching the interconnected rhizomes out of the mud is back-breaking, time-consuming work. Even with a garden hose, cleaning off all the embedded mud is also very labor-intensive, even more difficult for apartment dwellers doing this in a kitchen sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once cleaned, you can separate the starch from the inedible fibers by rubbing the fibers with your fingers in a bowl of water, and waiting an hour for the starch to settle to the bottom before pouring off the water. Every time I tried this, a got a few tablespoons of tasty starch—enough to thicken a pot of soup—after hours of work. Or you can also tear apart the rhizomes, dehydrate them in a food dehydrator, pound with a mallet, and sift. If you're into wilderness survival, you can chew on the washed rhizomes and spit out the fibers—definitely not fine gourmet dining!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only a few foragers report better success with cattail rhizomes than I've experienced. One said that they found large, easy to harvest rhizomes along the Banana River in Florida, but that's a subtropical habitat substantially different from the rest of the US. Harvesting cattails in sandy wetlands, rather than the muddy ones, might also make a difference, but don't expect this to be quick or easy if you decide to attempt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lateral shoots on the rhizomes taste like the shoots, but they're small and buried in mud, so it's easier to wait until they become substantial above-water shoots, in mid-spring, before harvesting them.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="nutrition">The shoots provide vitamins K and B6, plus iron, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium and manganese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immature, green flower heads and the pollen provide essential fatty acids, calories, and protein.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">The mucilaginous substance from between the leaves makes an excellent hand lotion. It's been used as an antiseptic for cuts and as a dental anesthetic, although I'm skeptical as to its efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rhizomes have been pounded into a poultice and applied to skin sores cuts, wounds, burns, stings, and bruises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pollen has been used externally and internally for bleeding, but I'd also have to see convincing evidence that it works before I'd use it.</field>

      <field name="cautions">Never yank out a cattail if there's an animal rights activist watching!</field>

      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Young cattail shoots resemble the poisonous daffodil (&lt;i&gt;Amaryllidaceae&lt;/i&gt;) and iris (&lt;i&gt;Iris spp.&lt;/i&gt;) shoots, which have similar leaves. But remnants of the previous year’s cottony seed heads make the cattail unmistakable, the cattail shoot has a tender, white, inner core, neither of these poisonous plants grows more than a few feet tall, and by mid-spring, the much larger cattail shoot becomes obvious, even for beginners.</field>

      <field name="placeOfOrigin"></field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a medium-sized, upright plant with a stout, unbranched, finely downy stem. It has large, smooth-edged, oval to lance-shaped leaves, spherical clusters of broccoli-like flower buds which yield fragrant, pink, five-petaled flowers. The seed pods are pickle-shaped.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This upright, unbranched plant has a stout stalk that's finely hairy under magnification. Growing from two to six feet tall, it contains a bitter, sticky, white, milky latex—protection against most insects, except for the monarch butterfly, which is adapted to the plant. Spreading, white rhizomes give rise to true roots and small or large stands of plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downy underneath, smooth above, and tapering to a rounded point at each end, the thick, velvety, toothless, broadly oval to lance-shaped, opposite leaves grow from four to nine inches long and two to 4.5 inches wide. The main vein is reddish, and the leaf stalk is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resembling loose heads of broccoli, the long-stemmed, spherical flower buds, 1.5 to five inches across, emerge from the upper leaf axils. The subsequent long-stemmed, fragrant, purple-pink, hooded, attractive flowers grow in umbrella-like spherical clusters that often droop. Each of the 30 to 120 flowers in each cluster grows up to 0.5 inch tall and nearly 0.25 inch across, divided into five radially-symmetrical parts. The five reflexed sepals grow longer than the flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teardrop-shaped, grayish-green, hairy, mature seed pods look like warty cucumbers. Growing up to four inches long, they become filled with tufts of silky hairs attached to tiny, flattened, brown seeds that disperse into the wind. Skeletons of the dead stalks and split seed pods often persist through the winter.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Upright, unbranched, stout-stemmed plant usually three to five feet tall&lt;br /&gt;•Stem with some very small, fine hairs&lt;br /&gt;•Opposite, smooth-edged, short-stalked, oval to lance-shaped leaves four to nine inches long and two to 4.5 inches wide&lt;br /&gt;•Flower buds in spherical clusters 1.5 to five inches across, emerging from the upper leaf axils&lt;br /&gt;•Long-stemmed, fragrant, purple-pink, hooded, radially symmetrical five-petaled flowers 0.5 inch tall and up to 0.25 inch across&lt;br /&gt;•Sepals longer than the flowers&lt;br /&gt;•Teardrop-shaped, grayish-green, hairy seedpods growing up to four inches long&lt;br /&gt;•Tiny, flattened, brown seeds attached to tufts of silky hairs&lt;br /&gt;•White, milky sap throughout&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Snap off the tender, young stems along with their leaves when the shoots first appear in mid-spring. Later in the spring, snap off the tender, breakable tops of the stems with their accompanying leaves and flower buds, or break off the flower buds separately. In late spring, break off the open flowers. In early- to mid-summer, snap off the small, immature, firm seedpods. Avoid any rubbery, maturing seed pods.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Milkweed tastes like a combination of asparagus and broccoli, and the immature seed pods have the texture of okra. Cook all edible parts 15 to 20 minutes in rapidly boiling water (don't start cooking with cold water), except for the open flowers, which only require 1 minute of boiling. This gets rid of the bitter, toxic, white sap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since many milkweed species contain cardiac glycocides, I used to follow the long-accepted recommendations of boiling most parts in 2 changes of water, but after other foragers never got ill after boiling once, I now boil once, and write to tell: Yes, 1 boiling turns out to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After boiling, drain in a colander and press the milkweed against its sides with a large serving spoon, to extract as much water as possible and reduce sogginess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the milkweed's boiling, preparing savory seasonings is optional. You can sautée garlic in olive oil and stir that into the drained milkweed, along with some tamari soy sauce or Bragg's liquid aminos (both of which contain salt and &lt;i&gt;emani&lt;/i&gt; or meaty flavors). Or sautée Thai seasonings, i.e., basil, ginger, cilantro, and hot peppers (optional), in coconut oil, and add that to the cooked milkweed along with some salt. Any source of salt, oil, and herbs or spices, all from 1 culinary tradition, should work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to transform it from a side dish into an entrée, include a culinarily compatible source of protein, i.e., whole grain noodles, glass noodles, tofu, texturized vegetable protein, cooked beans, or tempeh. You can get even more elaborate with the addition of other vegetables, nuts, diced pineapple, or mushrooms, again choosing a set traditionally used in one of the world's great culinary traditions.</field>
      <field name="nutrition"></field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Various Native American tribes used milkweed sap to remove warts, and to treat ringworm and bee stings, and they used an infusion of the whole plant as a laxative, for gravel and edema, mastitis, and a variety of disparate ailments. It's a folk remedy for asthma, bronchitis, cancer, catarrh, cough, edema, dysentery, dyspepsia, fever, gallstones, gonorrhea, moles, pleurisy, pneumonia, rheumatism, ringworm, scrofula, sores, ulcers, warts, and wounds, but there's no independent evidence that any of the aforementioned uses works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milkweed rhizomes contain cardiac glycosides with potential for treating heart disease, but without adequate research to characterize the properties of the individual chemicals, their specific effects on the different parts of the heart and circulatory system, correct dosages, or unusual individual reactions, so they could easily do more harm than good, and should be avoided until after such research gets the funding it deserves.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">Common milkweed is poisonous raw, and it gives some individuals vomiting and diarrhea even after it's cooked, so eat very small amounts of this plant at first, and gradually increase your portions until you're sure you don't get such reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to habitat destruction, common milkweed is rare in some regions. Please collect only where it's very common, and do not disturb any monarch butterfly caterpillars you may find on milkweed plants—they're in trouble due to habitat destruction too.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants"></field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Eat only common milkweed. Other milkweed species (&lt;i&gt;Asclepias spp.&lt;/i&gt;), which are poisonous, have smooth seed pods, and some have clear sap. Many grow in Western North America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young poisonous dogbane (&lt;i&gt;Apocynum spp.&lt;/i&gt;) shoots closely resemble those of common milkweed before dogbane begins to branch and develop different flowers, and the two plants often grow side-by-side. Dogbane has smooth stems, whereas a few small hairs grow on milkweed's stems, clearly apparent under magnification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milkweed shoots are fair game for experienced foragers armed with magnifying loops, but beginners who value their lives should stick to the distinctive flower buds, flowers, and young seed pods.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Break off the twigs any time. Strip off the leaves or flowers when present, and pick clusters of berries with your fingers.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Make an infusion of the fresh (drying them drives away the flavor) twigs, leaves, or berries.  Some people also like to chew on the twigs. Hunters use them as skewers to season venison, so they should work the same way for veggies or tofu. Don't eat the leaves. They have an unpleasantly bitter flavor that doesn't pass into the tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the finely chopped berries to season main courses, side dishes, and desserts. They're similar to allspice, and impart an exotic flavor to any recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The berries are too oily to dry, since oil becomes rancid upon exposure to oxygen whether or not there's water present. Freeze them separately on a plate, tray, or cookie sheet, then transfer them into a freezer container, where they won't stick together. Then you can remove and use them as needed.</field>

      <field name="medicinalUses">The Native Americans used a spiceberry cambium infusion as a diaphoretic for coughs, colds, and measles. They also used it for cramps, anemia, delayed menstruation, croup, and worms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They used the oil from the berries externally for chronic arthritis and bruises, and internally for flatulence and colic. Spicebush leaf, bark, or berry tea compresses were also used for mild skin irritations, i.e., rashes, itching, and bruises. These traditional uses have not been verified or disproven.</field>

        <field name="directions">Here’s my healthful, vegan version of one of the most common cookie recipes. As I've come to learn, refined white flour is totally unnecessary. The whole-grain flours make the cookies chewy and tasty. Likewise, a few dates and some liquid stevia do away with the need for white sugar, even with unsweetened chocolate’s intrinsic bitterness. Corn oil imparts the flavor of butter, lecithin granules and flax seeds replace the egg yolks and -whites respectively, and the seasonings, especially the common spicebush berries, enhance the other flavors. You’ll love these cookies, even if you're skeptical of vegan cuisine.	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-1/2 cup sugar-free vegan chocolate chips or carob chips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11 oz. buckwheat flour (2-1/3 cup) + 8 oz.

      <field name="generalInfo">Hairy throughout and growing from three to ten feet tall with a stout, slightly ridged, branched, hollow stem, this coarse-looking herbaceous perennial stands out whenever it grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With three deeply lobed and toothed leaflets, the huge, woolly, toothed, palmate-compound leaves often grow up to 16 inches long and a foot wide. Beginning  as basal leaves, they become alternate on the stem. The stout leaf stalks, each with a swollen base that has a broad wing, clasp the stem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In mid-summer, the umbrella-like flower heads emerge on the upper branches from buds on the stem that consist of swellings several inches across. Slender, long bracts widened near their bases extend from the base of the flower head. The flattened flower heads, which can grow up to eight inches across and are twice-divided, with spoke-like flower stalks, consist of numerous tiny, fragrant flowers up to 0.33 inch long, with notched, often purple-tinged, five-petaled white petals. The outer flowers are larger than the more central ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flowers give way to green, ovate, fragrant fruits, 0.375 to 0.5 inch long and 0.25 to 0.375 inch wide, with four conspicuous, vertical purple lines. Inside, ridged seeds, flattened on one side and rounded on the other, grow in tight pairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taproots or fibrous roots smell spicy, as does the rest of the plant.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Entire plant wholly and fragrant&lt;br /&gt;•Stout, slightly ridged, hollow stout stem three to ten feet tall&lt;br /&gt;•No purple blotches on the stem&lt;br /&gt;•Huge, three-parted, palmate-compound leaves up to 16 inches long and one foot wide&lt;br /&gt;•Leaflets deeply lobed and toothed&lt;br /&gt;•Doubly branched, flat-topped, umbrella-like flower heads up to eight inches wide, growing from upper branches&lt;br /&gt;•Tiny, white, five-petaled, fragrant flowers up to 0.33 inch long, with notched, often purple-tinged petals&lt;br /&gt;•Green, ovate, fragrant fruits, 0.375 to 0.5 inch long, 0.25 to 0.375 inch wide, with four conspicuous vertical purple lines&lt;br /&gt;•Tightly paired ridged seeds, flattened on one side and rounded on the other&lt;br /&gt;•Taproot or fibrous roots</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Cut off the young leaves and stems with a pocket knife or shears. Dig up the taproots with a shovel or trowel.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The best parts of this plant are the young leaf stalks and flower stalks, which taste like celery on steroids. Edible raw after peeling, they're too spicy for most people, but they're excellent simmered in soups or stews, or baked into casseroles. Some people boil them in a couple of changes of water to make the more mild tasting, but I don't find that necessary. Although people allegedly eat the young leaves raw, they're too hairy and strong-flavored to enjoy, inferior to the stalks, which you can peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taproots, which taste like parsnips and rutabagas, are edible in early spring and fall, but unfortunately, they're usually small and puny, often intergrading into fibrous roots, so that I've never had a satisfactory harvest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use the green seeds as seasoning in the summer, although I don’t find them very tasty. People add them to soups, stews, and breads, the way you’d use celery seeds or caraway seeds.</field>
      <field name="nutrition"></field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Various Indian tribes used a decoction of the roots for colds, coughs, sore throats, flu, headaches, indigestion, asthma, and cramps. They applied the chopped roots as a poultice for sores, bruises, swellings, boils, and arthritis. This plant isn't commonly used in herbal medicine today, and there's no convincing evidence of its effectiveness.</field>

      <field name="season">The taproot's in season in autumn and early spring, also in the winter where winters are mild, the ground isn't frozen, and there are rosettes around to indicate where to dig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flowers are in season in the summer and fall.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Sunny places with poor soil, empty lots, disturbed sites, fields, prairies, seashore areas, dunes, glades, thickets, and roadsides</field>
      <field name="range">Most of North America except for some of the Rocky Mountain states</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin"></field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves, each with a prominent whitish midrib. Its hairy stem is a tall, light green to reddish, with similar but smaller alternate leaves. Four-parted yellow flowers are at the ends of its branches with flat-topped, woody, cylindrical fruit capsules that split into four parts.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This native biennial arises from a white, fleshy, taproot, pink toward the top, that grows from two inches to over one foot long. A tight basal rosette of light or olive green, hairy, elliptical to lance-shaped leaves, sometimes slightly toothed, appears in early spring of the first year. Characterized by a prominent whitish midrib, the raggedy-edged, hairy leaves, which can survive mild winters but become tinged with red in cold weather, can reach nearly one foot in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosette returns early in the spring of the second year, but in mid-spring, an erect, stout, hairy, light green to reddish stem, unbranched or branched at the base, with similar but smaller alternate leaves forming a spiral pattern, reaches four to seven feet in height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long-stemmed, sweetly lemon-scented, four-parted yellow flowers, one to two inches across, bloom in terminal panicles from the tops of the branches in summer and fall, opening in the evening (to attract moths), and closing by noon. The bases of the broad petals unite to form a long, narrow tube. A distinctive four-parted stigma in the flower’s center forms an “X” shape. Drooping sepals grow beneath the flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each flower withers, the ovary matures into a flat-topped, cylindrical, woody seed capsule up to 1.5 inches long, full of tiny, hard, long, reddish-black seeds. The  dead stem with the seed capsules, which split into four sections, persists through the winter.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves, each with a conspicuous, white midrib&lt;br /&gt;•White, fleshy, spicy-scented taproot, pink on top&lt;br /&gt;•Stout, hairy, light green to reddish stem, usually branched at the base, with spiraling, lance-shaped leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Long-stemmed, sweetly lemon-scented, four-parted yellow flowers one to two inches across, in panicles at the tops of the branches, in summer and fall&lt;br /&gt;•Four-parted stigma in the flower’s center forming an “X”&lt;br /&gt;•Persistent woody, flat-topped, cylindrical seed capsules up to 1.5 inches long, containing many tiny, hard, long, reddish-black seeds</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Dig up the taproot with a shovel or trowel in early spring or in the fall (or in the winter where winters are mild.) If it's growing in the sand, the best place for collection, you may even be able to pull out the taproot by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick the flowers with your fingers in the summer.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The pungent pepper-and-radish flavor of the basal rosette's taproot is especially good in spicy dishes, such as chilly or curry. Simmer it 15 to 20 minutes. It thickens soups the way okra does, and you can even pickle it. Add it sparingly in dishes with mild-flavored ingredients, so it doesn't overpower them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tender, young leaves toward the rosette's center are too hairy to enjoy raw, but they’re alright simmered ten minutes in soups, though nowhere near as good as the roots. The peeled young stem is too fibrous to be worthwhile, but the mild-flavored flowers can add color to salads, and make an attractive garnish.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="nutrition">The seeds’ oil contains gamma-linolenic acid, gamma-linoleic acid (an anti-clotting agent), and vitamin F (essential fatty acids.) Gamma-linoleic acid is the precursor of PGEI. This is a prostaglandin, one of many short-lived fatty hormones—named because they were first isolated from the prostate gland. It regulates a variety of metabolic functions. However, you need industrial equipment to extract the oil, which is available in health food- and drug stores.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Cut or break off the tender parts of the stems when they first come up before the leaves unroll. Discard any hard parts of the stems, and all of the acrid leaves.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Enjoy the tender stems raw, chopped into salads, or steam or simmer them for 10 to 15 minutes, like asparagus. They taste like asparagus, only better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might be able to remove the rhizomes' bitterness and neutralize their strong laxative qualities if you cook them in lye water overnight, but there are so many better wild roots to cook, there's no reason to fiddle with caustic chemicals that may not even work.</field>

      <field name="medicinalUses">A poultice made from the roots of this plant was used to treat sunburns by American Indians, who also dried and smoked them to treat hyperactivity and depression.

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">The rhizomes are normally poisonous, although it's possible that with extraordinary treatment, they might be rendered safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This plant acts as a laxative in sensitive individuals, so begin with very small quantities and gradually increase your portions, and the bitter berries might cause diarrhea if anyone could [-somehow] manage to eat them in quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This plant is very abundant in some regions, and rare in others. Please collect sparingly unless this plant is very abundant, and go after other edibles where this plant is rare.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Other very similar edible subspecies, all of which can interbreed (which is why they're considered one species) grow across the US. The stem of feathery false lily of the valley (&lt;i&gt;M. racemosum ssp. amplexicaule&lt;/i&gt;), the most common subspecies of the West Coast, for example, grows erect instead of arching over. The leaves of starry false Solomon's seal are more narrow than those of false Solomon's seal, and its mature berries are black instead of whitish or pink-red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solomon’s seal (&lt;i&gt;Polygonatum biflorum&lt;/i&gt;), also edible, has tubular, six-parted flowers and dark blue, spherical berries that hang from the leaf axils, not in a terminal panicle, and the rhizome is whitish, not yellow-brown.</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">False hellebore (&lt;i&gt;Veratrum viride&lt;/i&gt;) is a swamp plant with an upright green shoot, but it's shaped more like the wide crayons toddlers use than a slender pencil, and the shoot and mature leaves are deeply pleated, like an accordion.

      <field name="harvesting">Harvest only where abundant, and please don't harvest where the plant is protected or endangered. Break off tender parts of the stems before the leaves unroll. Discard any hard parts of the stems and all the acrid immature leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dig up the rhizomes with a shovel or a trowel only where the plant is so crowded that thinning it out will be helpful.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Discard the acrid leaves and use the tender stems raw, or steam or simmer them for 10 to 15 minutes. They taste like asparagus, only better. Use them when they first come up, before the leaves begin to unfurl and the stems become tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because there are few places where they're abundant enough to harvest the rhizomes in my area, I only tasted one once. However, people grow them in their gardens, so if you garden, get them from a reputable supplier, grow them, and dig them up to your heart's content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're crisp, like water chestnuts, and somewhat sweet. You can eat them raw, slice and roast them in a light vegetable oil with sweet spices, or dry and grind them into flour. They're also suitable for soups, stews, and casseroles. They cook in 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The berries are not edible.</field>

      <field name="medicinalUses">A decoction of the root has been used for a wide variety of ailments ranging from indigestion to coughing. It's been used to treat menstrual cramps, PMS, and bleeding, as well as for lowering blood pressure and increasing concentration and mental clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A poultice of the roots has been applied topically on cuts and bruises, acute injuries related to tendons, joints, ligaments, muscles, bones, bruises, connecting tissues, and cartilage, as well as for osteoarthritis. Although there's no science upholding any of these claims, some of which derive from a European relative that's been used since ancient times, this plant definitely deserves to be tested.</field>

      <field name="cautions">This plant can be rare, and it's protected or endangered in some locations. Please go after more common plants where this is so, and be especially cautious about uprooting it, as this kills the plant.</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">This invasive, colonial, parsley and celery-scented plant, which spreads with long, white, branching rhizomes, begins its growth with hairless, long-stalked, three-parted palmate-compound basal leaves. Each oval, pointed, sharp-toothed, irregularly lobed leaflet grows from one to four inches long. The larger ones subsequently divide into another two or three lobes, the smaller ones don't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similar alternate leaves grow on the hollow, furrowed stem, which appears in mid- to late spring or early summer, and grows from 1.5 to over three feet tall. Flat-topped, umbrella-like flower clusters two to four inches across, consisting of tiny, five-petaled, white flowers, bloom at the tops of the branching stems in the summer.

      <field name="generalInfo">All you usually see of this seashore plant is its upright, leafless, green, branching, jointed, succulent stem, but that's enough to recognize these unique species.

Minute, green flowers, in groups of three to seven, hide in the joints of the upper branches, on stalks only 0.125 inch long. The seeds are tiny enough to escape notice too. These reduced features make it very difficult to distinguish between the various species of Glasswort, but there are several, most annual, and one perennial. However, no other plants with such an unusual appearance, and all species are equally edible.</field>

        <field name="directions">Boston Baked Beans with Glasswort	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many great recipes with which to experiment with, it took me 33 years to get to this one, and only happened because my wife had a craving for this dish. An uncharacteristically sweet bean recipe, burnt sugar extract and caramel extract (available at http://www.bickfordflavors.com/index.html), plus my standard liquid stevia sweetener, replace the sweet flavor of the traditional molasses (a refined, concentrated carbohydrate I avoid). Barbecue seasoning replaces the traditional sugary barbecue sauce, and glasswort takes care of the salt. And my wife had no time (or cause) to complain about these changes as she devoured the tasty result.	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 cups red kidney beans, soaked in water to cover overnight, or steeped in water off the boil 1 hour, drained, rinsed, and pressure cooked 15 minutes (or boiled 2-1/2 hours or until tender), drained&lt;br /&gt;2 cups vegetable stock or water&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup fruit-sweetened ketchup&lt;br /&gt;2 tbs. tomato paste&lt;br /&gt;2 red onions, chopped&lt;br /&gt;1 large red bell pepper, chopped&lt;br /&gt;5 Tofu Pups (vegan hot dogs, available in health food stores), sliced&lt;br /&gt;1 tbs. olive oil or corn oil&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup glasswort, chopped, or 2 tsp. Vege-sal (a seasoned salt available in health food stores), or 1 tsp. salt&lt;br /&gt;2 tsp. black peppercorns, ground into 4 tsp. (or to taste)&lt;br /&gt;2 tsp. barbecue seasoning&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp. cumin, ground&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp. liquid stevia (available in health food stores)&lt;br /&gt;1/4 tsp. caramel extract&lt;br /&gt;1/4 tsp. burnt sugar extract (optional)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bake covered in an oiled casserole dish in a preheated 350 degree oven for 2-1/2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serves 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparation time: 10 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baking time: 2-1/2 hours</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Strip off all the tender, young leaves, shoots, and tendrils when they first appear, in mid-spring. From late spring to early summer, break off the tender tips of the shoots along with any accompanying tender, young leaves. The flowers are edible, but too small to be substantial. And the berries are about as good as a rubber pencil eraser!</field>
      <field name="cooking">Greenbrier has a piercing, sweet-sour flavor, it’s one of my favorite salad greens. The young leaves, shoots, and tendrils are more delicate than any other wild vegetable. They're also great in sandwiches, soups, and casseroles, or steamed or sautéed. Cook no more than 5 minutes.</field>

Meanwhile, sauté the onion in the remaining olive oil 20 minutes, add the greenbrier and garlic, and sauté another 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.

However, their small size makes this way too labor-intensive.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">The tuber is an excellent source of starch and protein, and the seeds contain vitamins A, C, and E.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">The Indians applied a plaster of the tubers to &lt;i&gt;proud flesh&lt;/i&gt;, an excessive growth of granulation tissue that sometimes develops over an open wound.</field>

Take appropriate precautions: wear long pants, long sleeves, and work gloves, and actively look for this toxic plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't eat groundnuts raw. They taste terrible, and contain a protease inhibitor, destroyed by cooking—the same kind of chemical that's used to fight AIDS.</field>

      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Other legumes may have poisonous seeds, but they aren't twining vines with tight racemes of flowers, five to nine parted, feather-compound leaves, or rhizomes strung with tubers.

      <field name="group">Family: &lt;i&gt;Brassicaceae&lt;i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Cruciferae&lt;/i&gt;, the mustard or cabbage family</field>
      <field name="plantType"/>
      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">Young basal leaves: when they first appear, just before mid-spring, through mid-spring, and mid- to late fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller, upper leaves: mid-spring to early summer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flowers, immature seedpods, and tender tops of the stems: early summer</field>
      <field name="habitat">Full sunlight or partial shade, moist, disturbed soil, park lands, meadows, overgrown fields, and along roadsides and the edges of trails and woods</field>
      <field name="range">Throughout most of the continental US and southeastern and southwestern Canada, but not in Utah</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">This native of Europe and North Africa now grows around the world.</field>
      <field name="native"></field>



      <field name="harvesting">You can pull off bunches of basal leaves with your fingers, or cut them off just below ground with a pocket knife to get the entire rosette at once. Because this invasive plant is large, you can get lots of greens with no environmental impact very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the plant gets larger, strip the leaves off the stem and break off the tender tops of the stems. Do the same with the smaller, immature leaves, stem tops, and their accompanying leaves or flowers as the plant matures. Or strip off the flowers and any young seed pods (which quickly get tough) with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seeds themselves are too small to be worth harvesting.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Hedge mustard leaves, flowers (which are especially spicy), tender, young stem tips, and tender, young seed pods, all taste like the hot mustard you get in Chinese restaurants. Use them raw in soups or salad, or cook them, which reduces their pungency, for 10 to 15 minutes, in soups, stews, sauces, or casseroles. You can also chop and stir-fry them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids: This is one of the best plants for you if you don't like spicy food. Offer a whole bunch to your friend. Say: "Here, eat all these flowers. They're so-o-o sweet—you'll love them!" After a few seconds of chewing, your friend will start jumping up and down and searching desperately for water. You may lose a friend, but the laugh you'll get will make it well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Hedge mustard contains high concentrations of iso­thiocyanates, plant estrogens tailored to interfere with insect reproduction that block human estrogen and estrogen-like environmental contaminants from activating cell reproduction and causing the abnormal cell proliferation that may lead to cancer. Thus, including this plant and its relatives in your diet lowers your chances of getting cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over 40 hydrodistillates have been extracted from hedge mustard, and some of these show strong antibacterial activity against five gram-positive bacteria and other pathogens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most leafy green vegetables and other members of the mustard family, hedge mustard is probably loaded with vitamins and minerals, though no specific information is available.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Wearing heavy duty work gloves and using a pruning shears or a knife, carefully cut off the stout shoots after the leaf buds begin to open, but before the prickles harden and the individual leaflets separate. Trim off any hard leaflets and thorns in the field if you prefer.</field>

This counterproductive form of "heroic" herbalism, long rejected by science, is best relegated to the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, the decoction of the dried cambium, which doesn't have such harsh effects, was considered a stimulant and tonic. It was also used as eye drops for sore eyes, and to increase the flow of saliva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A poultice of the root has been used externally for skin eruptions, boils, varicose veins, sores that don’t heal, and swellings, and a tincture of the berries was widely used in various pain remedies, and for rheumatism and toothache, in colonial times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because parts of this plant are potentially toxic, it's not suitable to use for making home remedies.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="cooking">Honewort has a fresh green flavor, similar to commercial chervil and its relative goutweed—a combination of parsley, celery, and carrots. Collect it in the spring and use the leaves as a parsley-like seasoning raw, or cooked for five to ten minutes. It's an excellent seasoning for salads and savory dishes, like parsley or commercial chervil, and it's cultivated in Japan for use in sushi and miso soup. It's also good dried, like parsley. Especially useful in bean soups, you can crumble dried honewort into almost any savory recipe. It's possible to use it as a green, leafy vegetable too, although it's quite strong-flavored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use the mild-flavored, crunchy very young stem, or the stem tops, like celery, although the leaves are much more abundant. Use the tender, young, green seeds in place of celery seed in breads, muffins, soups, or stews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roots of the young plant are reputedly like parsnips or carrots in early spring and autumn, but I always find them small and tough.

      <field name="range">The Northeast Coast from New Jersey northward, the European Atlantic Ocean, reportedly off California and Japan too, and, if you live inland, in health food stores!</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">It's native to both sides of the Atlantic ocean.</field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a short, frilly, fan-shaped, cartilaginous seaweed up to six inches across, that may be dark purplish-brown to black, greenish-yellow, red, or even white. It's short stalks branch four or five times.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This short, frilly, fan-shaped perennial seaweed, up to six inches long, feels soft and cartilaginous (gristly). It's tough and elastic when wet, brittle when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually dark purplish-brown to black, it may also be greenish-yellow, or red. Underwater, it’s sometimes iridescent-blue (water blocks red light and lets blue through, so colors always get distorted underwater), and after enough bleaching in the sun, it turns white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing from a disk-shaped holdfast, the short stalk branches four or five times, creating a variable, fan-like shape with subsections up to 0.75 inches across, ending in crowded, frilled-looking tips.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Fan-shaped, cartilaginous-textured seaweed up to six inches across&lt;br /&gt;•Park purplish-brown to black, greenish-yellow, red, colored, or bleached white by the sun&lt;br /&gt;•Frilled margins&lt;br /&gt;•Short, flat stalks 0.75 inch across, branching four or five times&lt;br /&gt;•Disk-shaped holdfast</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Your best chance of harvesting Irish Moss along beaches is at low tide, especially after storms have ripped it from its underwater habitat, but the currents must be favorable too. However, if you visit the seashore often, pretty soon you'll be able to harvest a supply that will last for years, especially if you have a food dehydrator to preserve your harvest.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Unlike other edible seaweeds, this one is too tough to eat directly. But it contains a substance called carrageenan that makes a great thickener for puddings, soups, sauces, and gravies. Put a handful of fresh or dried Irish Moss in a cheesecloth or fine-mesh bag and cook it for up to an hour a sweetened liquid. Most of the Irish moss will dissolve, and you’ll get a tasty, creamy pudding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Irish simmer sun-blanched Irish moss (colored Irish moss discolors food) in milk (I use non-dairy milk) for 20 minutes, then discard it, to make blancmange, their traditional pudding. Use 1.5 cups of fresh seaweed or 0.5 cup reconstituted dried seaweed to thicken three to four cups of liquid. Cinnamon, sassafras, lemon, sumac, and licorice are good complementary seasonings. (Lemon juice and sumac concentrate cause soy milk to curdle, but they're fine with nut- or oat milk.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To thicken soups, stews, or sauces, simmer it in some of the broth for 20 minutes, strain it out, and return the broth to the recipe.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Irish moss is highly nutritious, and the dishes you make from it are easy for convalescents to digest. It provides vitamin B1, beta-carotene, iodine, sulfur, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, manganese, bromine, mucins, protein, and a little fat.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Carrageenan is considered an anti-coagulant, anti-inflammatory, demulcent, emollient, expectorant, and tonic, with the ability to coat the digestive tract and sooth peptic and duodenal ulcers. It’s used for thyroid problems such as goiter (for which it will be effective if the cause iis an iodine deficiency), and for gastritis, colon disorders and obesity. It also relieves diarrhea and helps form bulky stools, and there's evidence that it can lower high blood pressure. It's an especially valuable food for convalescents, especially after a bout of tuberculosis and pneumonia. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated anti-viral properties, supporting its traditional use for irritating coughs, bronchitis and many other lung problems, some of which are viral in origin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A syrup of Irish moss with rose hips, honey, and lemon has been used for sore throat, and a decoction helps heal chapped hands. Irish moss is also supposed to be helpful for treating radiation contamination, although I'd like to see convincing evidence that this is so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some sources have suggested that Irish moss is dangerous because processed extracts are toxic. But since the digestive system can’t release the carrageenan into the bloodstream, there's no evidence of any toxins absorbed, or of people getting sick after using this seaweed, these fears seem unfounded.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Avoid collecting in polluted areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Irish Moss also has anticoagulant properties, avoid it if you take prescription blood thinners such as Coumadin, and don't use it if you're suffering from Crohn's disease. </field>

      <field name="harvesting">Dig up the tubers with a shovel, easiest after rain has softened the soil and in locations with the fewest rocks. You can store them, refrigerated, for several weeks.</field>
      <field name="cooking">If your digestive system can handle them, the crisp, sliced tubers are excellent, raw, in salads, with a flavor like sunflower seeds, not like artichokes—a widely reported error. Although they've been cooked like potatoes, boiling them for long periods of time makes them mushy. However, they're great steamed, or simmered in soups. You can also sauté them 5 to 10 minutes, or stir-fry them for 2 minutes. I've also dehydrated them, ground them into powder, and used them along with whole-grain flour for baking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're excellent tossed in olive oil with herbs or spices and salt, and baked in a covered casserole dish about for 20 minutes or until just cooked through like a quick version of baked potatoes. People have also pickled them.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Jerusalem artichokes provide vitamins A, B1, and B3, as well as the minerals potassium, phosphorous, calcium, iron, and copper, plus fructose. They're also rich in inulin, a polysaccharide that doesn't get absorbed or elicit an insulin response, and is beneficial to people with blood sugar problems.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Considered an aperient, aphrodisiac, cholagogue, diuretic, spermatogenic, stomachic, and tonic in herbal medicine, it's been used as a folk remedy for diabetes and rheumatism, but needs testing for efficacy.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">These tubers, which you should eat in moderation at first, cause great flatulence in some people, especially if eaten raw. Avoid standing downwind from such individuals!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">This native sunflower isn't from Jerusalem, so its first name is probably a corruption of the Spanish word for sunflower, &lt;i&gt;girosol&lt;/i&gt;. Someone must have thought it tastes like an artichoke (it doesn't) and gave it its surname accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other members of the sunflower family (&lt;i&gt;Helianthus spp.&lt;/i&gt;), cultivated and wild, all non-poisonous, that look similar. However, only the Jerusalem artichoke's leaves have partially winged leaf stalks. None of the other species have tubers, and their other features also don't all match. Nevertheless, when someone on a Central Park tour refused to believe me, I lent her my shovel and let her dig for the tubers of one of the cultivated look-alike. Maybe she'll give up her fruitless (or tuber-less) search as we pass her by on my next tour, and I'll be able to recover my shovel!</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">Springing from shallow, fibrous roots, this branching, hairless annual grows from two to four feet tall, usually in dense stands. Segmented by thickened nodes, powdered with a waxy, blue-green bloom, and filled with a clear liquid, the succulent, translucent, smooth, pale green stems grows three to five feet tall and 0.75 inches wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In early spring, jewelweed begins as a smooth, slender, succulent sprout with one pair of toothless, circular to kidney shaped, blue-green leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subsequent wavy-toothed, oval, opposite (bottom) or alternate (upper), blue-green mature leaves grow from two to 4.5 inches long and 1.25 to 3 inches wide, with leaf stalks up to 2.5 inches long. The leaves repel water, either due to a wax on the surface, or because both the surfaces of the leaves and the water drops bear the same electrical charges, and therefore repel each other. This makes the leaves’ undersides shine silvery when submerged in water, and causes glistening, spherical drops to form on the leaves when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attractive, trumpet- or slipper-shaped flowers each hang suspended from a slender flower stalk. Blooming from late spring to mid fall, they grow to about 0.75 inch long, each with three petals, one which curls, forming a long tube with a flared opening, and ending in a narrow, curled base that looks like a spur. Spotted jewelweed’s orange flower is spotted with dark red, while pale jewelweed’s flower is yellow, with less conspicuous spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0.5 to one inch long, the green, cucumber-shaped seedpods consist of layers of tissue that dry and shrink at different rates, creating tension that’s released along the seams when touched. One to several tiny, ovoid, green-and-brown, turquoise, or blackish seeds disperse explosively.</field>

      <field name="cooking">Chop shoots no more than eight inches tall, boil for 20 minutes, discard the water, and use as a cooked vegetable. Mild flavored and delicate, it’s best as a side dish, with spices, salt, and a few drops of a light oil, or (after parboiling) added to soups, stews, casseroles, or rice. The sprouts shrink when you cook them, and while some people like them, I find them too unexciting and labor-intensive to prepare them very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tiny seeds taste like walnuts, fun for kids of all ages to gather, but too small for more than a trail nibble or garnish.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

It cures mosquito bites if you keep the bite wet with the fresh juice for 15 minutes, beginning right after you've been bitten. I've used it thousands of times, on myself and others.

It's excellent for nettle stings, minor cooking burns, sunburn, scrapes, rashes, and a wide range of other skin irritations, as well as for fungus infections such as athlete's foot and ringworm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rub it where you’ve touched poison ivy before you develop the rash, and unless you're hypersensitive to poison ivy, you won't get the rash. Jewelweed also seems to be effective against poison ivy rash once it’s developed in about half the people who try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chemists have synthesized anti-inflammatory chemical found in jewelweed, mixed it into an ointment, and apply it &lt;i&gt;where the sun don't shine.&lt;/i&gt; What did they create?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparation H!</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">This group of long-bladed, dark brown seaweeds normally grow up to ten feet long, with a flattened midrib, and thin, ruffled edges. When the seaweed reproduces, butterfly-shaped reproductive structures called sporophylls grow above the holdfast. Many kelp species have pneumatocysts—gas-filled bladders, usually around the base of the blade near the midrib.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different kelp species supposedly grow in the deep, cold, northern waters of the east and west coasts (an Alaskan variety grows 70 feet long), and if you’re not a scuba diver, you’re supposed to wait to gather it after a storm washes it ashore. Nevertheless, I found a ten-year supply of sugar kelp (&lt;i&gt;Laminaria sacchaina&lt;/i&gt;) while I was swimming in the Long Island Sound on vacation in Montauk, NY. The water was so shallow that I could hold my breath, swim down eight feet to the bottom, stuff a handful of kelp into my wet suit (you can also use a mesh bag), and come up for air to dive again.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Brown seaweed up to ten feet or more long&lt;br /&gt;•Flattened midrib&lt;br /&gt;•Thin, ruffled edges&lt;br /&gt;•Holdfast attached to hard object on seabed&lt;br /&gt;•Butterfly shaped sporophylls above the holdfast sometimes present</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Use goggles, flippers (if you have them), and a mesh bag. Take a deep breath, and dive (it also helps to know how to swim). Otherwise, wait for storms and the right currents to wash it onto beaches. If you have a food dehydrator, you can gather enough to last for years under the right circumstances.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Cook kelp in soups or stews, or with grains until tender. Some species are good to eat after simmering 10 minutes, others require over an hour of simmering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelp is also great cooked with beans. It helps soften them, and reduces the amount of gas they cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Wales, they sell kelp's midrib, which tastes like a salty carrot, as a fresh vegetable.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Kelp provides mucopolysaccharides and the sugar mannitol, plus algin, phenolic compounds, polar lipids, and glycosyl ester diglycerides, as well as protein, carbohydrates, and essential fatty acids. It provides beta-carotene, vitamins B1, B3, B5, B6, B9, B12, C, E, biotin, choline, inositol, and PABA. It's a source of around 30 minerals and trace minerals, including iodine, potassium, calcium, iron, zinc, copper, magnesium, selenium, sulfur, phosphorus, silicon, sodium, bromine, nickel, strontium, and vanadium.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">All seaweeds are high in sodium, so use them sparingly, and avoid them if you're on a low-sodium diet. Eating too much kelp can also give you too much iodine, so enjoy it in moderation. And, of course, avoid collecting kelp in polluted waters.</field>

      <field name="habitat">This tree grows naturally in rich soil in the woods, but landscapers plant it in urban and suburban parks, as well as on city streets, i.e., along the sidewalks in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan.</field>
      <field name="range"> It grows throughout much of the US east of the Rocky Mountains, and in Ontario, but not in New Hampshire, Vermont, Louisiana, or Florida. It has also been planted, locally, in other states.</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">This tree, with thick twigs and dark gray, scaly, deeply grooved bark, grows from 40 to 100 feet tall and up to 50 feet across. It bears gigantic, feather-compound, twice-divided, alternate leaves one to three feet long, with seven to 13 oval, toothless, paired leaflets. The leaves, which turn yellow in autumn, develop later and drop earlier than those of other trees. Also, the tiny leaf buds remain hidden under a woolly covering in the leaf axils, so the tree looks dead for half the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spring, green-white flowers hang from the leaf axils on loosely branching pyramidal panicles, three to four inches long on male trees, ten to 12 inches long on female trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanging from slender stalks one to two inches long, flattened, somewhat curved, brown, chunky, leathery, thick-rimmed seedpods, five to ten inches long, two to trhee inches wide, and one to two inches thick, ripen on the female trees in autumn.

      <field name="harvesting">Collect the seedpods when you they're available, and look for bare seeds on the ground under the tree, sometimes partially embedded in the soil. It may take your eyes a while to learn to spot them, and some places under the tree will have more seeds than others, so be patient and persistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or show a seed to a kid. They have sharp eyes, love searching for things, and get good at this very quickly.</field>
      <field name="cooking">This seeds provide an excellent caffeine-free coffee substitute. Even though the tree's unrelated to coffee, beverage's resemblance is so strong, I can't drink it (I dislike coffee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash off all the pulp and roast the seeds for 3 hours in a 300 degree F oven in a covered casserole dish or baking pan. The seeds sometimes pop like popcorn, and you don't want them all over your oven. Thorough cooking is required to destroy all toxins in the seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grind the seeds to the consistency of coffee in a blender, 0.5 cup at a time (they're too heavy to grind en masse in a coffee- or spice grinder), and brew in a coffee maker, like regular coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seeds also make a first-rate culinary seasoning, used like coffee, to flavor chocolate or mocha dishes, or Mexican moles. Crack the toasted seeds with a mallet or hammer, discard the shells, and grind a few seeds into a powder in a spice- or coffee grinder. Since you're using them as a spice, and not to make coffee, you won't be using so many seeds that you'll destroy your spice grinder.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">The Kentucky coffee-tree's green pulp and raw seeds are poisonous. They contain the cytisine, which suppresses respiration, plus hydrocyanic acid and saponins. These toxins are destroyed by thorough roasting, and none of the hundreds of people who collected them on my many tours every year going back to 1982 ever reported having been made sick from them. Also, the pioneers used these seeds as a coffee substitute in the past, with good results, although they missed the caffeine. Just rinse off the seeds and roast them as directed.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">The much longer, flat, twisted brown pods of the honey locust tree, which also has large, twice-divided, feather-compound leaves and has edible parts, is thorny, as is Devil's walkingstick, which has similar leaves but develops berries rather than seedpods. The Kentucky Coffee-tree bears no thorns, and you should have no trouble telling these species apart using if you look for these obvious differences.</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">The pods superficially resemble those of poisonous relatives in the legume family, although other features won't match. Eating the seeds the knobby green pods of wisteria (&lt;i&gt;Wisteria spp.&lt;/i&gt;) can be deadly. However, wisteria's a vine, not a tree, the Kentucky coffee-tree's pods are dark brown, not green, and you don't use it by eating the seeds!</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">In the early spring, this wetland plant, which grows from one to two feet tall, forms basal rosettes of shiny, round to kidney-shaped, shallow-toothed leaves three to seven inches wide, supported by long, thick, hollow, branching stems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shiny, waxy, yellow, showy flowers, which look like oversized buttercups, bloom from early spring through late spring—sometimes well into the summer. One to 1.5 inches across, they grow on short, thick, hollow, branched, succulent, stems in clusters of one to 7. Each flower has five sepals in place of petals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fruit is a small, dry, recurved capsule called a follicle. It ripens in late spring and summer, when it splits lengthwise to release its red seeds.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Cut off the young leaves and flower buds with a knife, or break them of with your hands. Waterproof footwear or wading boots will make them much more accessible. And use rubber gloves, since handling the plant can cause problems.</field>
      <field name="cooking">This is not a plant for unsupervised beginners—buttercups are poisonous, as is this one, if not properly prepared. Boil the young leaves or unopened flower buds without their stems or the roots in two changes of rapidly boiling water, one minute in the first water, then five to six minutes in the second batch of &lt;i&gt;boiling&lt;/i&gt; water. Don't use cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may subsequently pickle the boiled flower buds in hot vinegar with pickling spices, but you must discard the vinegar. Though not spectacular, if properly prepared, adequately seasoned (use any savory herbs or vinegar, some vegetable oil, and salt) marsh marigold leaves’ soft texture and mild flavor go well with other ingredients in soups, casseroles, or other vegetable dishes.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Marsh marigold leaves are a good source of iron, although this may be lost through the necessary boiling.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">People made an antispasmodic decoction for children’s fits by boiling the roots. The decoction was also used to help cough up mucus from the lungs, to induce sweating, stimulate the immune system to combat infections, and as a laxative. People have also chewed the roots and applied them to inflamed wounds as a poultice, and to remove warts. Nevertheless, the plant contains potentially deadly toxins, so this plant is not a suitable for home remedies.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">This is not a plant for unsupervised beginners. Prepare only as directed. The plant contains the acrid, if aptly named, glucoside, called helleborin, plus another toxin called protoanemonin. Symptoms of poisoning include a burning sensation in the throat, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, dizziness, fainting, and convulsions. Even too much handling can cause a severe rash, so wear gloves when you handle it.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Let's dispel some of the great confusion that plant causes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The marsh marigold is not a marigold (&lt;i&gt;Tagetes patula&lt;/i&gt;) at all, but a member of the buttercup family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. A completely different edible plant is also called cowslip (&lt;i&gt;Primula veris&lt;/i&gt;). Although it grows in England, not in America, American herb books sometimes refer to it without differentiating between the 2 species, leading to accidental misuse of the American plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. A similar-looking member of the buttercup family that grows in partially sunny habitats in wet woodlands, lesser celandine, also has young leaves which are edible boiled, but it's smaller, the leaves lack teeth, and each leaf has a black stripe running along its length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. A smaller relative, floating marsh marigold (&lt;i&gt;C. natans&lt;/i&gt;), also edible, has small white or pinkish flowers, kidney-shaped leaves, and stems that may float. It grows from Alaska southeastward to northern Minnesota. </field>

      <field name="generalInfo">This stout, upright, spreading, fragrant, semi-evergreen shrub, with light gray bark and many branches, grows three to 12 feet tall and equally wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting off red-tinged, the dark green, shiny, oval, leathery, strongly aromatic, elliptical leaves grow 1.5 to four inches long and 0.5 to 1.5 inches wide.

Some leaves overwinter, become increasingly brown, and remaining fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inconspicuously flowering in late spring and early summer, the male flowers are yellow green catkins, while the tiny, green female flowers, growing individually and  blooming on separate bushes, lack sepals and petals. They cluster on the branches beneath the shrubs’ leafy tips, to be replaced by stalkless, chalky, gray-white, waxy, BB sized berries that ripen in late summer and fall.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Simply strip off the leaves with your fingers.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Use bayberry leaves the same way as you use commercial bay leaves (&lt;i&gt;Laurus nobilus&lt;/i&gt;), but use twice the volume of bayberry leaves. Their flavor is vastly superior to commercial bay leaves. Add them to soups, stews, gravy, tomato sauce, salsa and beans, and remove them after the recipe is done. Putting them in a tea bag, tea ball, or tying them into a piece of cheesecloth makes them easier to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The leaves are easy to dehydrate for long-term storage.</field>
      <field name="nutrition"></field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Thanks to the resins that permeate the northern bayberry and its relatives, all parts of these bushes have important medicinal uses. The leaves are carminative. Add them to bean dishes, and they'll reduce the amount of gas the beans cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cambium, leaves, and roots are used as a tonics, stimulants, and astringents. A decoction of the cambium or roots supposedly improves circulation and tones tissues, particularly in the stomach and intestines. It's used to clear up mucus congestion of the head and stomach, and a hot tea, which contains the anti-microbial compound myrictrin, is used for colds, fevers, and to promote the flow of bile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an astringent, the decoction was used for hemorrhages, as a gargle for sore throats, and as a wash for gum disease. Externally, a compress of strong tea was used for varicose veins, swelling from insect bites, and as a douche. The leaves are the weakest part, best for less severe conditions. Although all these various uses haven't been tested, and you shouldn't experiment on yourself with them for serious conditions, they certainly should be researched.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Be sure to remove bayberry after cooking. Commercial bay leaves are tough and sharp enough to cut people’s stomachs, sometimes necessitating surgery. This is less likely with the wild species, but you have nothing to lose by enclosing the leaves in a tea bag, tea ball, or a piece of cheesecloth, and removing them when the recipe is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mricadiol, which this herb contains, reportedly makes you retain sodium and excrete potassium, just the opposite of what you need for cardiac health. This is not a problem for normal culinary use, but for this reason, extended use of high concentrations for medicinal purposes is inadvisable.</field>

      <field name="similarPlants">Roseroot (&lt;i&gt;Sedum rosea&lt;/i&gt;), also edible, resembles orpine, but it’s smaller, with untoothed, spirally arranged, overlapping leaves. A circle of leaves surrounds its yellowish or purple four-petaled flowers, and the large, inedible roots smell like roses. Also, the plants' ranges differ—roseroot grows in colder places such as Canada, or on mountain tops in New England.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="season">Depending on the climate and latitude, the fiddleheads are in season for only about ten days toward the end of early spring. And the timing varies from year to year, depending on whether there's an early or late spring.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Partially shaded or sunny, rich, damp ground, moist woods, riverbanks, alluvial plains, and swamps</field>
      <field name="range">Easterm North America and southeastern Canada</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">A circumpolar plant, it's also native to northern Europe and parts of Scandinavia</field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a large, colonial vase-shaped fern arising from a black, knobby base, with tall, unbranching, twice-divided fronds tapering rapidly upward and slowly downward, surrounding more dense fertile fronds. Or, a hairless fiddlehead with a groove running along its back, a stout base tapering upward, and large, brown, papery scales.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Snap off half the fiddleheads of each bunch with your hands, along with the accompanying stems. Don't collect unrolled ferns, which are poisonous, and please don't deplete the rhizome by collecting more than half the fiddleheads of each bunch.</field>
      <field name="cooking">This is one of the few wild foods sought-after by restaurant chefs and touted in food columns and blogs, and it deserves the attention it's getting. Its delicate flavor lies somewhere between that of asparagus and snap peas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rub off the scaly membrane under running water in a tall colander set into a shorter bowl. Drain, chop, then steam, simmer, or saut334 the fiddleheads for 5 to 10 minutes. They're somewhat dry, so if you're serving them as a stand-alone vegetable, add a light sauce (i.e., a lemon sauce). The contrast will turns the fiddlehead's dryness into an asset. Avoid overseasoning or overcooking fiddleheads, or you'll drown out their wonderful flavor.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Ostrich fern fiddleheads provide lots of vitamin A and niacin, some vitamin C, the minerals potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and iron, and the trace minerals manganese, zinc, and copper.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses"></field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">Mature ostrich ferns are poisonous. Eat only the fiddleheads before they've unfurled, and cook them. Raw fiddleheads eaten in quantity may cause severe diarrhea, and they can destroy the body's reserves of thiamine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most other wild vegetables, fiddleheads don’t grow back after you pick them. Be sure to collect only where very abundant, and take no more than half the fiddleheads from any bunch, to avoid depleting the rhizome of nutrients and killing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>

The cinnamon fern’s (&lt;i&gt;Osmunda cinnamomea&lt;/i&gt;) fiddlehead looks like the ostrich fern's, but it's one of the hairy, bitter species. It doesn't arise from a single base, and its fertile frond is reddish and knobby, not feathery like the ostrich fern’s. Nevertheless, people who want this to be the ostrich fern (which they only know under the name of "fiddlehead") pick and eat it, and try to ignore its hairs and awful flavor.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Some deadly plants such as poison hemlock have finely divided, fern-like leaves when mature, but they never form fiddleheads, and exhibit only the most superficial resemblance to the ostrich fern.</field>

      <field name="cooking">In early summer, you can add the young, unfurling leaves and tender tops of the stem raw in salads, steam or sauté them lightly, or cook them 10 to 15 minutes in soups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crunchy, nutty-flavored seeds are great raw or lightly toasted. You can snack on them, or add them to cereals, like nuts. You can also cook them like a grain, boiled 20 to 30 minutes or until tender in twice their volume of water, with a dash of vegetable oil and seasonings. You can also grind them into flour and use with whole-grain flours.</field>

      <field name="cautions">Eating the leaves growing in water entails the same risk of chemicals or pathogens as drinking the water, so use the leaves only where the water's been tested. And don't harvest bare-footed—slobs tend to throw glass bottles into shallow water, and your feet can get badly cut! Also, don't wade without wading boots unless you're sure the water's free of parasites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One person reported to me that he experienced a delayed reaction to eating the seeds—numbness in his throat and mouth, with a very unpleasant burning, prickly sensation—every time he tried them. This may be a rare individual reaction, but you should try very little of this plant the first time, and gradually increase you portions.</field>

You can dig up the bulbs, which are at their best &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the leaves are gone, in the summer, fall, and winter (if the ground isn't frozen), as long as you can recognize the plant when it's in flower or seed, or you can spot the plant's skeleton from late fall to early spring.</field>

      <field name="howToSpot">Look for dense stands of medium-sized onion/garlic scented plants with two to three smooth, pointed, elliptical, parallel-veined, light green basal leaves. Ramps have short, hairless, purple, scallion-like leaf stalks, each wrapped in a sheath. There's a smooth, slender, round, erect, unbranched, leafless, reddish stem. A small, dome-shaped flower cluster grows above a pair of short-lived bracts on top with close to 35 white-stalked, small, creamy white, six-petaled flowers. The flowers become tiny, hard, shiny, spherical black seeds, grouped in threes.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Growing in dense stands, this onion/garlic-scented plant has but two or three smooth, pointed, elliptical, parallel-veined, light green leaves—basal only—four to 12 inches long and one to three inches across, with arising from, hairless, purple, scallion-like leaf stalks wrapped in a sheath. Growing in bunches up to ten inches across, they come up in early spring, then yellow and die in mid-spring when the trees shade them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In early- to mid-summer, a smooth, slender, round, erect, unbranched, leafless, reddish stem grows from six to 18 inches tall, with a sheath at the bottom. At the apex, close to 35 creamy white, six-tepaled flowers, each around 0.125 inch across and 0.25 inch long, bloom in a dome-shaped cluster 1.25 to 2 inches across, above a pair of short-lived bracts. Each flower has its own slender, whitish flower stalk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From late summer through fall, tiny, hard, shiny, spherical black seeds, grouped in threes, supplant the flowers. Some of the leafless stems persist over the winter, indicating the locations of the two to six layered, pear-shaped, onion-like, white bulbs, each about 0.75 to two inches long and covered in a light brown papery wrapping.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Dense stand of onion/garlic-scented plants with only two or three smooth, pointed, elliptical, parallel-veined, light green basal leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Leaves four to 12 inches long and one to there inches across, with parallel veins, growing in bunches up to ten inches across&lt;br /&gt;•Leaves yellowing and dying from mid- to late spring&lt;br /&gt;•Short, hairless, purple, scallion-like leaf stalks wrapped in a sheath&lt;br /&gt;•Smooth, slender, round, erect, unbranched, leafless, reddish stem growing from six to 18 inches tall, with a sheath at the bottom, in the summer&lt;br /&gt;•Terminal flower cluster dome-shaped, 1.25 to two inches across, above a pair of short-lived bracts&lt;br /&gt;•Close to 35 six-tepaled creamy white flowers, each around 0.125 inch across and 0.25 inch long&lt;br /&gt;•Each flower with a slender, white flower stalk&lt;br /&gt;•Tiny, hard, shiny, spherical black seeds grouped in threes&lt;br /&gt;•Two to six layered, pear-shaped, white, onion-like bulbs, each about 0.75 to two inches long&lt;br /&gt;•Entire plant strongly scented of onions and garlic when injured</field>
      <field name="harvesting">In early spring, hold down the stems with one hand, and pull off bunches of the leaves with the other hand, or cut them with a knife or shears. The bulbs are puny while the leaves, which have taken up all their nutrients, are in season, but the leaves are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulbs are much larger after the leaves wilt, so dig them up with a shovel or trowel from mid-spring through fall, or even in the winter, if the ground isn't frozen and you can recognize the skeleton of the seed stalk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ramps have been over-harvested in some locations, but they're very common in other places. Please don't collect them where they're rare, and collect only a small proportion, especially when harvesting the bulbs, where the plant isn't very common.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Use the rightfully prized, strong-flavored leaves and bulbs like scallions or shallots—raw in salads, or cooked, using nearly any method in virtually any savory recipe.&lt;br /&gt;Ramps are the best tasting member of the &lt;i&gt;Alliums&lt;/i&gt; (the onion/garlic group). They make fantastic soups (try using them in your favorite traditional leek and potato soup), stews, sauces, and casseroles. You could also simply steam the leaves for 5 to 10 minutes and serve, seasoned with salt and pepper, as a superb vegetable side dish. A ramp dip is exquisite too. The bulbs make excellent pickles, and you may also dry ramps, or freeze them after cooking. Dried, powdered ramps make a terrific seasoning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the plant flowers in the summer, the flower stalk extends into the bulb and forms a hard core, which needs to be cut out with a paring knife. This usually isn't the case in autumn.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Ramps provide vitamins A and C and some vitamin B1, plus potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and iron.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Not much used medicinally, ramps probably have medicinal uses similar to wild and commercial garlic species. Native Americans used the leaves as a spring tonic, and to treat colds and croup. They also treated earaches by applying the warm juice of the bulbs and leaves externally. </field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">This plant can lead to the loss of your romantic partner and all your friends—saying that it causes bad breath is a colossal understatement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collect small proportions of ramps where they are common, avoid collecting where rare, and please don't over-harvest.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">The ramp isn't similar to the commercial leek *(A. porrum)* or most other &lt;i&gt;Alliums&lt;/i&gt;, all of which are edible. Although these relatives all smell like onions or garlic, the ramp is almost the only species with broad leaves. Only 1 rare edible relative, also called the wild leek (&lt;i&gt;A. burdickii&lt;/i&gt;), has broad leaves, but they're much smaller, only 1 to 2 inches across, and only 10 to 20 flowers grow in each cluster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ramp flowers resemble those of sarsaparilla, (&lt;i&gt;Aralia nudicaulis&lt;/i&gt;), but this odorless medicinal plant has large, feather-compound leaves when it flowers, and all its other features are completely different from the ramp's too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ramp is misleadingly named after an edible European plant, the rampion &lt;i&gt;(Campanula rapunculus&lt;/i&gt;), which looks different and doesn't grow wild in America—quite fortunate, since it's very dangerous—just look what befell Rapunzel after her dad filched one from a witch's garden to satisfy the craving of his pregnant wife!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">The poisonous lily of the valley's &lt;i&gt;(Convallaria magalis)&lt;/i&gt; leaves resemble ramps, but this garden plant, which also grows wild, has no odor, and the flowers, seeds, and roots are completely different from the ramps'.</field>

Freeze them with water in ice cubes and serve them in drinks, or use them in wine-making. You can pickle the unopened flower buds too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a week or so, when they've first appeared but before they get tough, you can use the tender, young pods, raw or lightly cooked, like snow peas. Their season is shorter than any other edible plant I know, so unless they grow near where you live, they're very easy to miss.

        <field name="title">Redbud Blossom Cookies</field>
        <field name="slug">redbud-blossom-cookies</field>

        <field name="directions">Here’s a successful example of my radical approach to cooking, successfully replacing the conventional white flower, sugar and eggs that make cookies such nutritional national disaster areas with whole-foods vegan ingredients that work. The wild redbud flowers, complemented with just the right seasonings, add the final touch to make these cookies perfect. I originally designed these cookies without any crunchy ingredients so my then-11-month-old daughter could safely eat them, and she loved them as much as I do.	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 oz. (2 cups) sweet brown rice flour + 6 oz. (1 cup) buckwheat flour, or 18 oz. of other whole-grain flours&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup flax seeds ground into 1/2 cup meal&lt;br /&gt;3 tbs. arrowroot&lt;br /&gt;1 tbs. xanthan gum&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp. salt&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp. cream of tartar&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp. baking soda&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp. cinnamon, ground&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Blend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-1/2 cups pear juice&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup corn oil&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup lecithin&lt;br /&gt;2 tsp. liquid stevia&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup commercial currants&lt;br /&gt;1 tbs. fresh lemon rind&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp. orange rind&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp. vanilla&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 cup redbud flowers	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Mix together the dry ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Pur&amp;#233e; the ingredients to blend in a blender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Don’t overmix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Stir in the redbuds. Don’t overmix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Shape into about 36 cookies and place on 3 nonstick cookie mats on 3 cookie sheets, or on 3 oiled cookie sheets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Bake 10 minutes or until lightly browned underneath, in a preheated 400 degree oven, turn over with a spatula, and bake another 5 to 10 minutes on the other side. Be careful to avoid scorching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Cool on wire racks.	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes 36 cookies	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparation time: 30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooking time: 20 minutes</field>

      <field name="range">This seaweed grows in the North Atlantic, but similar close relatives you can use the same way grow in the North Pacific.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Gather the best-looking plants at low tide, when they're the most accessible. Sometimes large quantities get washed up by storms.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The best parts of this plant are the reproductive organs. They taste like pickles—great sliced and added raw to salads and sandwiches, in place of pickles, or cooked in virtually any savory recipe, using any variety of cooking methods. They cook in 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also dehydrate rockweed, then add a tiny amount of oil and a good amount of spices, and roast it in the oven at 300 degrees F, 30 to 60 minutes, or until crisp, for a unique snack food. I've tried this with curry powder as well as with chili powder, but any spice combination should work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades, which cook in about 15 minutes, taste like fish—great for vegan mock fish recipes, fish sauces, or Worchestershire Sauce. They're excellent simmered in soups, stews and grain dishes. And I always use rockweed, which you can add dried, when I make vegetable stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use rockweed sparingly. It's very strong-flavored, and can overpower other ingredients. And don't add salt—rockweed provides plenty of sodium, and you can always salt to taste at the end of the recipe if necessary.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Rockweed is a great source of iodine, bromine, sodium, potassium, and chlorine, as well as alginic acid and many trace minerals.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Modern science upholds the traditional medicinal uses of this plants for a variety of ailments. Herbalists used to recommend rockweed for thyroid problems such as goiter. If the cause was an iodine deficiency, it was beneficial. However, rockweed's iodine content varies, and nowadays the precise dosages of iodine available through modern medicine are much safer and more effective. Rockweed has been used traditionally for weight loss, and although it's only effective when excessive weight is caused by thyroid problems created by iodine deficiency, you still find it in many of the ineffective herbal weight loss products being pandered today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rockweed lowers blood cholesterol levels, accounting for its traditional use for heart disease (it's also a weak blood thinner, reducing the chance of the coronary artery blood clots that produce heart attacks). Since estrogen is made from cholesterol, it also lowers estrogen levels, accounting for its traditional use for menstrual problems. Furthermore, Japanese women, who traditionally eat lots of seaweeds, have low rates of breast cancer (until they adapt a Western diet), another apparent benefit of this plant and other seaweeds, which have been used traditionally to fight cancer (some breast tumors need estrogen to grow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research also upholds rockweed's traditional use for kidney and bladder inflammations. It probably works because it contains mannite, an osmotic diuretic agent and a weak renal vasodilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A poultice of rockweed has been used applied externally for arthritis, rheumatism, enlarged or hardened glands, burns, and scalds, and people chewed it for bleeding gums. These uses have not been researched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Enjoy this plant in moderation. Rockweed contains alginic acid, a laxative, so eating too much could can cause diarrhea. And it contains sodium—not good for people on a low-salt diet. Eaten in excess over long periods of time, it can give you too much iodine, resulting in an overactive thyroid gland. And people who are allergic to iodine or are taking iodine for medical reasons should also avoid this plant, as should those with acne, which, according to the latest research, iodine can worsen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it's a blood thinner, avoid it if you're already taking medicines with the same effect, i.e., aspirin. And, since it effects estrogen levels, don't use it if you're being treated medically with drugs that effect such hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rockweed can pick up heavy metals from the water, so don't collect it in polluted waters.</field>

      <field name="habitat">Sassafras grows on dry, acidic soil, in old fields, on the borders of woods, in open woodlands, on bottomlands, in thickets, along fencerows and roadsides, on lower slopes, in urban parks, and on neighborhood streets.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Pull up small saplings to harvest the cambium—easiest to do with other people, after rain has softened the ground, and on slopes. You'll have no environmental impact if the saplings aren't growing in full sunlight, since even partial shade eventually kills them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could also cut through the bark of a recently storm-felled tree to get at the cambium, but this isn't easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can collect twigs or leaves for making tea, but this will be much weaker than tea made from the cambium. However, you can strip off the young leaves for making gumbo filé.</field>

Discard the underlying wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or simmer the whole root (or just the cambium) 20 minutes in a covered pot, strain, and serve a reddish-brown, flavorful decoction. The longer you simmer it, the stronger it gets. A small piece goes a surprisingly long way, and you can use the root over and over. Stir chilled (heat makes carbonated beverages go flat) sparkling water into a chilled decoction (an excellent ice tea in its own right) with a sweetener, and you'll have root beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also make a delicious jello by simmering ground sassafras cambium in fruit juice with agar. Use less agar and you'll get sassafras jelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry young sassafras leaves and grind them into a powder in a spice grinder or blender to make gumbo filé—an expensive gourmet product used to thicken soups. Stir a few tablespoons into a soup after it's finished cooking, turn off the heat to prevent it from becoming to gummy, and you'll have a delicious Louisiana gumbo.</field>

Often torn before being washed up onto shore, it reminds me of green plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may discolor black when it dries out or decomposes, or it could become bleached white by the sun.

      <field name="harvesting">Collect it, bag it, and use it within a couple of days—it's perishable</field>
      <field name="cooking">Refrigerate it as soon as possible, and use it within a day or two, because it spoils very quickly. Wash it thoroughly under running water, in a colander set into a low bowl, to get rid of all the sand. Change the water in the bowl several times, and make sure all the tenacious sand is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you can eat some raw, finely chopped, it’s a little tough. It's much in soups or stews, stir-fried, or saut&amp;#233ed; 10 to 15 minutes. You can also freeze it after cooking.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Sea lettuce provides iron, protein, iodine, aluminum, manganese, and nickel, as well a beta-carotene, B-complex vitamins, vitamin C, starch, fat, and sugar.</field>

      <field name="cautions">Pollution may make this seaweed grow in huge amounts. If this all washes up on a shore and decomposes, it may produce deadly hydrogen sulfide gas, which smells like rotten eggs. This has killed people in France in 2009. If you smell rotten eggs as you approach the seashore, head inland immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eat this seaweed in moderation.  It can give you too much iodine, resulting in an overactive thyroid gland.

      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">Collect nettles when they first appear in early spring until they flower and become unsafe to eat, close to late spring. People think nettles are only good in the spring, but autumn's new growth is just as good as the spring form, if not quite as abundant. Collect these until they're destroyed by frost.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Partially shaded, moist, rich, soil, disturbed habitats, fields, open woodlands, edges of trails, thickets, and riverbanks </field>
      <field name="range">Most of the continental US, Canada, and Mexico, as well as most of the temperate world</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">European and American varieties grow in the US, but because this plant is covered with thousands of tiny hypodermic needles, evolutionary biologists think it originated in the South Bronx!</field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a hairy, erect, unbranched, herbaceous plant with a stout, ribbed, hollow stem, and creeping, spreading rhizomes. Stinging nettle has oval, long-stalked, dark green, opposite, rough-textured, coarse-toothed leaves with pointed tips and heart-shaped bases and long. Slender paired panicles of tiny, green, inconspicuous flowers and fruits hang from the upper leaf axils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel for a painful sting when you touch the plant (but only if you're really dumb!)</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Densely covered with hollow, stinging hairs (as well as non-stinging hairs) that can contain acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, and formic acid, this unbranched colonial plant develops a rather stout, ribbed, erect, four-sided, hollow stem growing from three to seven feet tall, plus creeping, branching rhizomes it uses to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The somewhat oval, long-stalked, dark green, opposite leaves, with a rough, papery texture, grow two to six inches long and one to two inches wide. The leaf tip is pointed, the base is heart-shaped, and the teeth get larger toward the long leaf tip. A pair of stipules grows at the base of each leaf stalk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blooming from late spring to early fall, long, slender, paired panicles of tiny, green, inconspicuous flowers droop from the upper leaf axils—male and female flowers growing on separate plants. The fruits, which contain tiny seeds, resemble the flowers.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Densely hairy, erect, unbranched herbaceous colonial plant with stout, ribbed, four-sided, hollow stem, growing from three to seven feet tall&lt;br /&gt;•Creeping, spreading rhizomes&lt;br /&gt;•Oval, long-stalked, dark green, opposite, rough-textured leaves, two to six inches long and one to two inches wide&lt;br /&gt;•Leaf tip pointed, leaf base heart-shaped, teeth increasingly large toward the tip&lt;br /&gt;•A pair of stipules at the base of each leaf stalk&lt;br /&gt;•Long, slender paired panicles of tiny, green, inconspicuous flowers and similar fruits hanging from the upper leaf axils&lt;br /&gt;•Many stinging hairs throughout the plant</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Collect nettles wearing gloves, or put your hand inside a bag. Long sleeves and long pants also make harvesting easier. Use entire young shoots a few inches tall, and strip off the smaller leaves near the tops of larger plants. They come off most easily if you strip them from the top down. Keep the tough stems for making tea.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Stinging nettles impart a strong, rich, satisfying flavor and chewy texture to any cooked vegetable dish, and even light cooking (or drying) destroys the stinging effect. Delicious when properly prepared, nettles get a very bad rap in countless literary works, usually by culinarily clueless authors from England, a country world-famous for its exceptional cuisine (but not because it's exceptionally good!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't boil stinging nettles in water. This removes their flavor and nutrients, and makes them taste awful. Rinse, chop, then steam the young leaves for 5 to 10 minutes or until just wilted, in a heavy pot, covered, with no additional water (which would dilute their flavor). Then season them with olive or other oil, savory herbs, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook nettles in soups, stews, or rice, adding them during the last 5 minutes of the cooking time. Include cooked nettles when making stuffing and pesto too.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">One of the most healthful foods on Earth, nettles provide more protein than any other green, and they’re very high in readily absorbable iron, plus calcium, chromium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorous, manganese, silica, iodine, sodium, sulfur, and zinc. They’re also high in carotenoids, vitamins C, K, and B-complex, as well chlorophyll, lecithin, flavonoids, sterols, and tannins.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Stinging nettles sting. This causes minor skin irritation that disappears within an hour for me, whereas for some people, it's equivalent to a bee sting! Wear work- or rubber gloves when handling raw nettles, and don't run through a field of nettles wearing shorts! If stung, apply the juice of crushed jewelweed stems, common- or long-leaf plantain leaves, or curly dock leaves—all quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t use nettles after they begin flowering around mid-spring, when they get tough and stringy. Much has been made about the dangers the gritty cystoliths that form at that time, and how these can irritate the urinary tract, but the cystoliths are just baking soda!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don't collect in soil contaminated with nitrates, which nettles readily absorb.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Slender nettle (&lt;i&gt;U. gracilis&lt;/i&gt;), with sparse stingers, has lance-shaped leaves, fewer stinging hairs, and none on its leaves' upper surfaces.  Wood nettles (&lt;i&gt;Laportea canadense&lt;/i&gt;) have larger, rounded leaves—opposite when the plant’s very young, alternate when mature. Both of these relatives are delicious in their own right, and you can harvested and prepared any true nettles the same way as stinging nettles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearweed (&lt;i&gt;Pilea pumila&lt;/i&gt;), is a similar-looking, nonpoisonous but relatively tasteless relative, without stinging hairs. Henbit deadnette (&lt;i&gt;Lamium amplexicaule&lt;/i&gt;) is a musty-smelling, non-poisonous hairy mint with similar opposite leaves that droop, and a square stem, but the showy, two-sided pink flowers of this non-edible softly hairy plant are also different, and it doesn't sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stinging nettles have a square like a mint, and look a little like catnip, but nettles no fragrance and they don't attract cats. Also, no one has ever been stung by catnip!</field>

      <field name="cooking">Nettles impart a strong, rich, satisfying flavor and chewy texture to any cooked vegetable dish, and even light cooking (or drying) destroys the stinging effect. Rinse, chop, then steam the young leaves for five to ten minutes or until just wilted, in a heavy pot, covered, with no additional water (which would dilute the flavor), and season with olive or other oils, savory herbs, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook nettles in soups, stews, or rice, adding them during the last five minutes of the cooking time. Include cooked nettles when making stuffing and pesto too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't boil nettles in water. This removes their flavor and nutrients, and makes them taste awful.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Although there's no direct research on this plant available, they're probably very similar in nutrient content to stinging nettles , providing more protein than other greens, plus iron, plus calcium, chromium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorous, manganese, silica, iodine, sodium, sulfur, and zinc, as well as carotenoids, vitamins C, K, and B-complex, plus chlorophyll, lecithin, flavonoids, sterols, and tannins.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Not widely used like stinging nettles, slender nettles probably have very similar medicinal properties. The freshly-squeezed nettle juice, loaded with nutrients, might help rebuild the strength of the chronically ill, and could be a good topical treatment for nettle sting. It may also help with digestive problems, prostatitis, hepatitis, gall bladder inflammation, hay fever and osteoarthritis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An infusion of the leaves is probably a safe, gentle diuretic, good for the kidneys and bladder, and it may be helpful for cystitis and nephritis. If it's also high in vitamin K content, it should help blood clot, and be useful for excessive menstruation, bloody coughs, and nose bleeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tincture of the whole plant might be good for flu, colds, bronchitis, pneumonia, and eczema, or to promote lactation.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Slender nettles sting. This causes minor skin irritation that disappears within an hour for me, whereas for some people, it's equivalent to a bee sting. Wear work- or rubber gloves when handling raw nettles, and don't run through a field of nettles wearing shorts! If stung, apply the juice of crushed jewelweed stems, common- or long-leaf plantain leaves, or curly dock leaves—all quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t use nettles after they begin flowering around mid-spring, when they get tough and stringy. Much has been made about the dangers the gritty cystoliths that form at that time, and how these can irritate the urinary tract, but the cystoliths are just baking soda!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't collect in soil contaminated with nitrates, which nettles readily absorb.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Stinging nettles have oval leaves, stinging hairs on both surfaces of the leaf, more stingers throughout, and drooping flower panicles. Wood nettles have larger, rounded leaves—opposite when the plant’s very young, alternate when mature. All true nettle species are delicious, and you can harvested and prepare them same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearweed (&lt;i&gt;Pilea pumila&lt;/i&gt;), is a similar-looking, nonpoisonous but relatively tasteless relative, without stinging hairs.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="cautions">Wood nettles sting as effectively as stinging nettles, injecting you with acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, and formic acid—more painful and long-lasting for some people than others. However, these stinging hairs are completely harmless if you simply avoid touching them! Wear work- or rubber gloves when handling raw nettles, as well as long pants and long sleeves. If stung, apply the juice of crushed jewelweed (&lt;i&gt;Impatiens spp.&lt;/i&gt;) stems, crushed plantain (&lt;i&gt;Plantago spp.&lt;/i&gt;) leaves, or crushed dock (&lt;i&gt;Rumex spp.&lt;/i&gt;) leaves—all quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t use nettles after they begin flowering around mid-spring, when they get tough and stringy.

      <field name="harvesting">Cut off the seed head before the seeds ripen completely or the birds will get them all. They'll ripen in a supermarket shopping bag, although a mesh bag, that allows more air circulation, is even better. Take care that moisture doesn't cause any of your seed heads to get moldy, especially if they were collected after the rain.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="cooking">Enclose the seed head in a paper or mesh bag for a few of weeks until the seeds dry and mature. Don't crowd to many seed heads together, especially if you collected them after it's rained, or they'll get moldy. Remove the seeds from the seed head, and eat them raw or lightly roasted: You can roast them in a 300 degree F oven for 40 minutes or until crisp, stirring often. Crack them with your teeth and eat them like commercial sunflower seeds. You can also pre-boil the seeds in water with spices, olive oil, and salt for 15 minutes. You can try curry powder, black pepper, chili powder, lemon juice, fresh garlic, a Thai spice mix, Italian herbs, or any combination of these and other flavorings that you can imagine. Drain the seeds, add a dash of olive oil and salt to taste, and roast them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild sunflower seeds are smaller than commercial ones, so shelling them by hand is too tedious to be worth it. You could coarsely grind the seeds with water in a blender, transfer to a bowl of water, and separate the floating shells from the nutmeat, which sinks, but this is also very labor-intensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could also boil the ground seeds and skim off the sunflower seed oil that rises to the surface, to use in salad dressings or for cooking. Or roast the shells and use them as a caffeine-free coffee substitute, the way you’d use coffee beans, Kentucky coffee-tree seeds, or chicory root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also sprout the seeds: Soak them in their shells overnight to begin germination, then tie them in a mesh bag or stocking and hang them over the sink to drain. Rinse a twice day. When the new root is as large as the seeds, plant them in a shallow tray of rich soil, water occasionally, and give them plenty of sunlight. In about a week, after the first leaves have opened, cut off the sprouts to use as snacks, or include them in salads, soups, or cooked vegetable dishes. Their peppery taste and chewy texture make them a favorite of adults and kids. And the clipped seeds may provide a second harvest in another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, some people eat the flower buds of wild sunflowers, but the plant is so rare in my area that I've only found it once (and it was absent from where I'd found it the following year), and haven't been able to verify how well this works.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">One of the few wild plants high in calories, sunflower seeds also provide protein, vitamins B2 and C, plus linoleic acid, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, and iron. The sprouts are even more nutritious than the seeds.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Not commonly used medicinally nowadays, a tea made from the leaves is considered astringent, diuretic and expectorant, and it's been used for high fever, probably not with much effect. People also crushed leaves and applied them to sores, swellings, snakebites and spider bites as a poultice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flower head and seeds are considered a febrifuge, nutritive and stomachic, while the seed is supposed to be diuretic and expectorant, and it's been used for lung problems, but convincing evidence of its efficacy is lacking.</field>

      <field name="cautions"></field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Various non-poisonous relatives in the sunflower family (&lt;i&gt;Helianthus spp.&lt;/i&gt;) don't produce seeds, and they have different-colored flowers or different leaves. The Jerusalem artichoke, for example, is a perennial that never sets seed, but has edible tubers the common sunflower lacks. It's coarsely hairy, branches mostly toward the top, and has large, coarsely hairy, oval to lance-shaped, slender, three-ribbed, pointed, toothed leaves and partially winged leaf stalks, rather than the sunflower's heart-shaped to triangular leaves. The several composite flower heads consist of 12 to 20 yellow ray flowers encircling a central, yellow-brown disk, rather than the brown-purple disk of the common sunflower.</field>

They're at their best from early- to mid-spring, before the plant flowers, and from mid-fall, when new basal rosettes appear, through late fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immature seedpods are edible in late spring, before they get tough.</field>

The long-oval, pointed leaflets also divide into threes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fve small, sparse, flat-topped, umbrella-like terminal clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers grow above recurved, linear to lance-shaped bracts.

      <field name="generalInfo">This attractive herb, which smell like licorice or anise when injured, begins in early spring with a basal rosette of deeply toothed, twice-compound, often slightly hairy leaves with long, purple leaf stalks. The leaves can grow up to one foot long. They're divided into groups of three.  The long-oval, pointed leaflets, also in threes, grow up to one inch long. The terminal leaflet is always the largest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In late spring, a smooth, light green, reddish-tinged, hairy, somewhat branched stem, with alternate leaves similar to but smaller than the basal ones, grows from one to three feet tall. For about two to three weeks in late spring to early summer, it produces five small, sparse, flat-topped, umbrella-like terminal clusters of eight to 16 tiny, white, five-petaled flowers 0.125 inch across. Recurved linear to lance-shaped bracts grow beneath the flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing the flowers, painfully sharp, slender, black, ribbed, crescent-shaped, tapered, barbed seedpods mature from green to black in mid-summer and fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A short, stout, gnarled, light brown underground base gives rise to many tightly packed, small, light brown, fleshy taproots, white inside. They grow four to six inches long.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Pinch off the leaves or flowers with your fingers. Dig up the roots with a shovel or trowel, taking only a fraction of the plants where they're very abundant, and remove the taproots, which are the best parts to eat, from the tough base.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Add the leaves, flowers, or tender young stems raw to salads, or add them to soups, stews, or desserts, at the end of the cooking time, to preserve the delicate flavor. They cook in about five minutes. Their delicate licorice flavor also makes them an especially good garnish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discard the hard, gnarled, underground base above the taproots (or steep it to make tea, which you can do with any part of the plant) and use the fleshy, strongly licorice-flavored taproots, the best part of the plant, grated or sliced, like you'd use carrots. Use them sparingly, or they'll overpower the other ingredients in your recipe. Edible raw, they're also great in soups and stews, as well as dessert dishes. I add them, grated, to ice cream, include them in smoothies, and always put some into oatmeal and cooked cereals. I also keep some grated roots in the freezer, to use as a seasoning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may also nibble on the immature green seedpods before they get tough, or use them in salads and cakes in place of anise seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t dehydrate this plant or it will lose all its flavor and become as tasteless as my jokes. But you can freeze the taproots raw or cooked. They're already adapted to freezing in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">This spring ephemeral's smooth-edged, shiny, lance-shaped, ovate, to elliptical, pointed, fleshy, basal leaves grow three to six inches long and about one inch wide, with nearly no leaf stalks. Sterile plants have but one leaf, fertile plants have two. Purple-brown mottling makes the leaves resemble the skin of a speckled trout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A solitary, nodding, yellow, six-tepaled flower one to two inches wide, streaked with reddish lines, emerges from the ground atop a long, smooth, slender, leafless stalk four to ten inches tall, blooming from early- to mid-spring. The tepals are bent backwards, revealing six brown stamens and one thick pistil. It's followed by an ovate fruit in late spring, before the plant dies to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A solid, light brown, tooth-shaped corm 0.33 to one inch long, white inside, grows deep underground. Stolons help the plant, which also spreads by seeds, grow into dense colonies.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Grasping a few at a time, break off the young leaves before the flowers appear. You may also dig up the corms with a shovel or trowel while the leaves are very small and the corms' food reserves haven't been tapped yet, but this is quite labor-intensive and barely worth the effort. If you're going to undertake this, do so where the plant is at its most dense.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The leaves have a pleasant flavor similar to that of cucumbers, so they're excellent chopped and added raw to salads or sandwiches. They're also fine cooked 5 to 10 minute in any dish that calls for vegetables, using any cooking method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the time and patience to collect enough of them, you can prepare the corms like potatoes.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Trout lilies provide vitamin C, as well as alph-methylene-butyrolactone, which has anti-mutagenic activity and may help prevent cells from becoming cancerous.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Cherokees and other Native American tribes used the crushed plant as a soothing emollient on inflamed surfaces, such as rashes, bruises, and sores that won’t heal. They’d also drink an infusion of the corms for fever. It would be nice to see these uses tested experimentally.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Eat this plant in very small quantities at first, and increase your portions slowly—it makes some people throw up. And don't eat the leaves after the flowers appears, when they becomes slightly toxic.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Although the corm’s shape may resemble a dog’s tooth, the ineptly named dog tooth violet is no more a violet (&lt;i&gt;Viola spp.&lt;/i&gt;) than it is a dog (&lt;i&gt;Canus domesticus&lt;/i&gt;), or even a trout (&lt;i&gt;Salvelinus fontinalis&lt;/i&gt;). It is a lily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many other similar edible close relatives, (&lt;i&gt;Erythronium spp.&lt;/i&gt;) grow throughout the US.

The color of their flowers varies, as do their leaves, which are mainly feather-compound, basal or alternate, usually with light green splotches. Large-leaf waterleaf (&lt;i&gt;H. macrophylum&lt;/i&gt;), for example looks like Virginia waterleaf, but the leaves are divided into at least seven lobes, and it’s rough-hairy. Broad-leaved waterleaf (&lt;i&gt;H. canadense&lt;/i&gt;) has maple-like leaves, with the flower stalks beneath the leaves. </field>

      <field name="season">New leaves come up toward the end of early spring, and are at their best until the plant flowers, in mid- to late spring. Although the plant remains edible through the summer, it plant becomes excessively spicy and somewhat bitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New young leaves return in the fall, but become harder to pick as the weather gets cold. Frosts cut the plant down to the level of the water, where it picks up too much annoying-to-clean autumn detritus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also sometimes find watercress during warm spells in the winter, especially in regions where the winters aren't cold.</field>

It has fleshy, wavy edged, feather-compound, smooth basal leaves divided into three to 11 smooth-edged, oblong to oval, opposite leaflets. The alternate leaves on the hollow, grooved, trailing stem are similar, but they partially clasp the stem, which is upright at the its end. White, fibrous roots emanate from the stem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terminal and axillary racemes from the upper leaves bear tiny, white, four-petaled flowers, followed by short, slender, slightly curved, long-stalked, cylindrical seed capsules.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Usually floating in dense mats in shallow, cold, flowing, fresh water, this hairless, toothless European mustard first appears toward the end of early spring.  Its fleshy, trailing, hollow stems, attached at nodes to fibrous, white roots, grow upright at their ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes turning purple in cold weather, the delicate, glossy, basal leaves grow 1.5 to to six inches long. Fleshy and wavy edged, these feather-compound leaves divide completely into segments of three to 11 smooth-edged, oblong to oval, opposite leaflets—the end leaflet always being the largest. The youngest leaflets aren't divided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In early summer, terminal racemes of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers 0.2 inch across grow atop the grooved, hollow stem, which reaches up to 6 inches tall. Some racemes also arise from the upper leaf axils. Below, alternate leaves similar to but smaller than the basal leaves, grow from leaf stalks that partially clasp the stem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In mid-summer, the flowers give way to short, slender, slightly curved, cylindrical seed capsules one inch long, growing at the ends of long seed stalks, with four rows of tiny, spherical seeds inside. Watercress spreads vegetatively as pieces break off, as well as through its seeds.</field>

      <field name="nutrition">Watercress is more nutritious than anything you can buy. Only dandelions and lamb's-quarters rival it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's loaded with more vitamin A and C, carotenoids, folic acid, iron, and potassium than any vegetable you can buy. It’s also an excellent source of flavonoids, vitamins E, B1, and B2, as well as the minerals and trace minerals phosphorus, sodium, iodine, manganese, sulfur, zinc, copper, cobalt, and vanadium. It also provides arginine, aspartic acid, beta carotene, biotin, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, pantothenic acid, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Always have the water tested for pathogens before eating this plant raw, especially near where sheep, which carry liver fluke, graze. Fortunately, cooking destroys parasites. [-(no wonder you never see politicians or lawyers cooking!)]</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Other mustards, all edible, resemble watercress somewhat, but they're also all terrestial, not aquatic. Winter cress, for example, has thicker, glossy leaves and yellow flowers. It grows in moist areas. So does yellow watercress, another mustard with yellow, 4-petaled flowers, as well as long, narrow, regularly lobed leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duckweed (&lt;i&gt;Lemna species&lt;/i&gt;) often grows along with watercress. With smaller flowers than any other North American plant, its tiny, opposite, unlobed leaves are so tiny, people confuse it with pond algae. People around the world have eaten various duckweed species, so while it's unlikely that any of them are poisonous, the plant is too puny to be worth picking, and you should avoid accidentally collecting it when gathering watercress.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="habitat">Asparagus grows in partially sunny habitats, pastures, fence rows, old, sandy uncultivated or old cultivated or fields, disturbed sites, open woods, and roadsides, although I find it most often in fields that associated with salt marshes. </field>
      <field name="range">Although wild asparagus grows throughout the US and southern Canada, especially in farming areas, it's not common everywhere. After &lt;i&gt;stalking the wild asparagus&lt;/i&gt; in the Greater NY area since 1980, to my great frustration, I've only found it in a handful of places, and never in any abundance.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for thin, crooked, hairless, unbranched green shoots that resemble commercial asparagus, with scales becoming crowded toward the tip, at the start and just before mid-spring. In the late spring and summer, look for a plant shaped like a Christmas tree, with hairless, upward- facing branches. They have feathery, needle-like leaves, six-tepaled, yellow-green, narrowly bell-shaped flowers, or tiny, short-stalked, spherical, bright red berries in twos or threes.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Wild asparagus begins like a familiar, if thinner and more crooked, version of commercial asparagus. Alternate, triangular scales become crowded toward the tip the hairless, unbranched, green shoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on, a hairless branched stalk, which reaches two to seven feet in height, grows feathery, needle-like leaves (actually modified stems) 0.75 inch long, on very slender, upward-curving branches. At this stage, it resembles a Christmas tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arising from the junctions of the branches and grouped in sets of two or three, tiny, yellow, short-stalked, six-tepaled, yellow-green, narrowly bell-shaped flowers just over 0.125 inches long, bloom in late spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are separate male and female plants, so only the females have the thin-stalked, spherical, poisonous, bright red berries, 0.375 inch across, which ripen in the summer. Inside are three to six tiny seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asparagus’ much-branching rhizomes give rise to colonies. As with many other wild edibles, dead overwintered stalks, here shaped like small, wilted Christmas trees, provide a marker for the following spring's new growth.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Unbranched, hairless, scaly, green shoot, resembling commercial asparagus, but thinner and more crooked&lt;br /&gt;•Alternate, triangular scales becoming crowded toward the shoot's tip&lt;br /&gt;•Hairless mature stalk two to seven feet high with very slender, upward-curving branches&lt;br /&gt;•Mature leaves feathery, needle-like, 0.75 inch long&lt;br /&gt;•Flowers and berries in sets of two or three, arising from the junctions of the branches&lt;br /&gt;•Tiny, yellow-green, thin-stalked, six-tepaled, narrowly bell-shaped flowers, just over 0.125 inch across&lt;br /&gt;•Thin-stalked, spherical, bright red berries, 0.375 inch across, containing three to six tiny seeds&lt;br /&gt;•Persistent winter skeleton resembling a small, dead Christmas tree</field>
      <field name="harvesting">You can cut off the young stalks from just below ground level, and clip the tips of somewhat larger stalks, but don’t harvest mature plants—they’re mildly toxic. Also, be sure to let some stalks mature fully, supplying the rhizomes with nutrients for next year’s growth.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Although you can nibble on the smallest and most tender shoots raw, asparagus is best cooked. Although you can sometimes find raw asparagus in restaurant salads, if you eat too much raw, it may act as a laxative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tie the tender parts of the stalks together with a string and place this in a tall pot of boiling water with just the tougher bottoms are submerged. Simmer, covered, five to ten minutes, or until just tender. You may add seasonings such as olive oil, wild or commercial bay leaves, thyme, oregano, or marjoram to the water if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Season cooked wild asparagus with salt, pepper, and a dash of olive oil, or stir in some hollandaise sauce, and serve piping hot. You can also add wild asparagus to almost any soup or stew five to ten minutes before it’s finished cooking, or include it in casseroles.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Asparagus is especially rich in beta-carotene and vitamin C. It's also an excellent source of vitamin E, B1, B2, B6, and folic acid, as well as the minerals potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, iron, and zinc, plus the trace minerals chromium and selenium. It also contains asparagine, saponins, flavonoids, a volatile oil, a glucoside, gum, resin, and tannic acid.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Asparagus is a traditional diuretic. It's supposed to cleanse and tone the urinary tract and help clear urinary obstructions. Herbalists recommend the juice for edema and kidney stones. In addition, the grated shoots have been used to make a stimulating facial wash, applied externally for 10 minutes. It's been recommended for oily and acne-blemished skin.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Don't eat too much raw asparagus, lest it give you diarrhea, and avoid the mildly toxic mature plant and berries.</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">This stemless perennial, which grows from four to 12 inches tall, has 2 large, long-stalked, toothless, heart-shaped, velvety, ginger-scented basal leaves that grow from three to six inches across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arising from the crotch of the two hairy leafstalks and hidden beneath the leaves (it's pollinated by ground-dwelling bugs), a solitary, slender-stemmed, dark brown-purple, flower without petals blooms from early- to mid- spring.

      <field name="harvesting">Please harvest the rhizomes sparingly, using a shovel or trowel, only where they're very abundant, and only thin out very dense patches.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Although this plant isn't related to commercial ginger, you use it the same way, as a seasoning or tea, in about twice the volume as the less delicate-flavored commercial plant. Add the ground rhizome, fresh or dried, to fruit dishes, baked goods, curries, ice creams, pies, puddings, or any other dessert or appropriate main course or side dish.</field>
      <field name="nutrition"></field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Ongoing research has uncovered antibacterial and anti-fungal properties of wild ginger, which contains aristolochic acid, a substance that kills bacteria and inhibits tumor growth. And a related Asian species have also been used with success in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Native Americans used a decoction of the rhizomes for gastric upset, indigestion, nausea, coughs, menstrual cramps, and fevers, and there's extensive anecdotal evidence that it works. They also used it to prevent food spoilage, consistent with its antibacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Native Americans and colonists inhaled the dried, powdered rhizome like snuff, for sinus congestion and headaches, and applied the crushed rhizome to inflamed and infected cuts and wounds. A decoction was sometimes even cooled and poured directly into infected ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This plant is included in many current herbal formulas as a circulatory stimulant, to increase the other ingredients’ effectiveness.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Collect only a limited quantity from large, dense stands, so you don’t damage the plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some recent research indicates that the aristolochic acid this plant contains could be toxic to the kidneys, but since this plant, which has been so useful for hundreds of years, hasn't been getting people sick, its moderate use as a seasoning and tea doesn't seem unduly risky, although it's your choice whether or not to use it.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Other edible forest plants, such as garlic mustard and violets have heart-shaped leaves, but they're all toothed rather than smooth-edged, the leaves don't grow in pairs, and they don't smell like ginger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes called "coltsfoot," wild ginger is a completely different plant from an unrelated medicinal plant with the same name, &lt;i&gt;Tussilago farfara&lt;/i&gt;, a relative of dandelions.</field>

      <field name="season">The taproot of the wild parsnip's basal rosette stage stores food underground in autumn, when it becomes edible, and remains so until mid-spring, when stored food moves to the growing above-ground parts and the root becomes tough and woody. With the absence of leaves in the winter, plus frozen soil, the root's generally unavailable then, so unless you live where winters are very mild and the basal leaves persist, harvest it in the fall and early spring.</field>
      <field name="habitat">This fragrant garden escape grows in sunny spots on damp, disturbed soil, in empty lots, wetlands, and fields, as well as along edge habitats and roadsides, both inland and near the seashore. </field>
      <field name="range">Throughout most of North America except the Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Europe</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a rosette of large, stalked, unbranched, feather-compound, hairless, basal leaves divided into five to 15 coarse, ovate to oblong, deeply lobed, variably saw-toothed leaflets on both sides of a midrib. There's a stout, deeply grooved, hollow, branching, hairless stem three to five feet tall; upper stems ending in long-stalked, flat-topped umbrella-like flower clusters three to eight inches across, without bracts. Terminal flower clusters divide into 15 to 25 umbrella-like clusters ending in many tiny, long-stalked, yellow, five-petaled flowers, followed by many small, long-stalked, fragrant, flat, ribbed, oval seeds.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">In early spring of both its teo years of life, this biennial produces a basal rosette six inches high. The large, stalked, unbranched, feather-compound, hairless basal leaves grow close to one foot long and four inches wide, with five to 15 coarse, ovate to oblong, deeply lobed, variably saw-toothed leaflets on both sides of a midrib.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In mid-spring of its second year, a stout, deeply grooved, hollow, branching, hairless stem grows from three to five feet tall. Resembling the basal leaves, stalked alternate leaves grow near the bottom. They become progressively smaller and nearly stalkless higher up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upper stems end in long-stalked, flat-topped, terminal, umbrella-like flower clusters three to eight inches across, without bracts. These divide twice, ending with 15 to 25 umbrella-like clusters of 12 to 35 long-stalked, yellow, five-petaled flowers, 0.125 inch across—hundreds altogether. Each flower becomes a long-stalked, fragrant, flat, ribbed, oval seed 0.25 inch long, ripening in late summer and fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The single, thick, whitish, fleshy taproot, which smells like commercial parsnips, can grow over one foot long.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Dig up the taproots of the basal rosettes with a shovel or trowel in early spring or fall. In sandy soil, you might be able to pull out the taproot if you grip its top firmly with your hands. Don't collect any other parts of this plant, and avoid skin contact with the leaves.</field>
      <field name="cooking">More coarse-looking that its commercial forerunner, the wild parsnip is more flavorful and sweeter. Although it’s edible raw, large quantities may be laxative, and it has a tough, stringy texture. Cooking tenderizes it and brings out its remarkable sweetness. It’s a good steamed vegetable, but it’s exceptionally tasty in soups or stews, or cooked with whole grains—way better than commercial parsnips, cooking in about 20 minutes. You can also use it for making stock.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Wild parsnips provide calcium, potassium, phosphorus, vitamin C, and fiber, as well as more calories than most wild foods—especially important for survivalists.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Some sources recommend a tea of parsnip leaves for diabetes, as well as for kidney and urinary problems, with warnings that too much may lower the blood sugar excessively. The only problem is that the leaves are poisonous! Use only the root of the basal rosette, and avoid other parts of the plant. There are plenty of safe medicinal plants around.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">Wild parsnip leaves contain furanocoumarin, highly concentrated when the plant is flowering (when it's not edible anyway). It can cause a severe rash if you're exposed to the sun after contacting the leaves with sweaty skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medieval European monks, forced to be self-sufficient, poisoned themselves by eating the leaves, so eat only the taproots of this plant!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">The wild parsnip resembles the rare prairie parsley (&lt;i&gt;Polytaenia nuttallii&lt;/i&gt;), a non-poisonous Midwest endangered plant with much more sparse, light-yellow flowers, and leaflets with way fewer teeth.</field>

      <field name="cautions">Wisteria flowers cause nausea and vomiting in sensitive individuals, so taste very small quantities at first, then gradually increase your portions. If your stomach begins to feel queasy, avoid this food. Use only opened flowers, not the unopened flower buds, which are much more likely to cause problems. Raw flowers are more likely to cause bad reactions than cooked ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seeds that the pods cast off contain a toxic glycoside called wisterin, as well as toxic lectins. Don't subscribe to such &lt;i&gt;pod-casts&lt;/i&gt;! Just two seeds can cause mild to severe nausea, repeated vomiting (sometimes bloody), abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In severe cases, dehydration, collapse, and death may occur. Otherwise, recovery usually occurs within 24 hours.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Japanese wisteria (&lt;i&gt;W. floribunda&lt;/i&gt;), also edible, is similar to &lt;i&gt;Wisteria sinensis&lt;/i&gt;, but it twines clockwise. The two species readily hybridize, and there's no need to try to tell them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar but smaller American species (&lt;i&gt;W. frutescens&lt;/i&gt;) is also edible, but with shorter racemes and smooth seedpods. It blooms in the summer. There are other edible wisteria species, also hard to distinguish, and they may also hybridize.</field>

      <field name="habitat">This tree thrives in full sunlight, although it tolerates partial shade. It grows in rich woods, in cultivated parks, along urban and suburban streets, along the edges of woods, on the borders of streams, and sometimes even on dry, sterile, gravelly hills.</field>
      <field name="range">The honey locust tree grows wild in sunny and partially shaded places throughout the Central and Atlantic states, and it's been planted extensively in parks and along streets throughout the country. </field>

      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a tall street or woodland tree with gray to blackish bark consisting of long, smooth, flat plates separated by furrows, sometimes with clusters large, sharp, branched thorns. Alternate, feather-compound leaves are often subdivided into three to six side branches then eight to 14 small, oblong, toothless, usually opposite, leaflets. Racemes of small, inconspicuous, fragrant, yellow-green flowers hang from the leaf axils with long, flat, bumpy, green seedpods that twist and blacken in the fall.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This common street tree grows from 60 to 100 feet tall (75 feet is common), with a crown 50 feet across. The gray to blackish bark consists of long, smooth, flat plates separated by furrows. It's sometimes armed with clusters large, sharp, branched thorns, often grouped in threes, although some varieties, especially those planted as street trees, are thornless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternate, feather-compound leaves four to eight inches long often subdivide into three to six side branches.  They don't appear until late spring, and fall off in early autumn. The eight to 14 oblong, toothless, usually opposite leaflets grow 0.75 to 1.25 inches long. Dark green and shiny above, they turn yellow in autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Racemes of small, inconspicuous, fragrant, yellow-green flowers, four to eight inches long, hang from the leaf axils in early summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In mid- and late summer, the flowers give way to long, flat, green seedpods, six to 16 inches long and one to 1.5 inches wide, with up to 20 flattened, ovate, green, bean-like seeds under 0.5 inches long. The bumpy, leathery, strap-like pods curve, twist partially, and turn dark reddish-brown in autumn, when a sweet, sticky, green-yellow, banana-scented pulp forms inside, and the seeds darken and harden.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Pick the very young, immature, green seedpods from the branches within reach in early summer, or open them to remove the edible seeds in mid-summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gather the brown, mature pods from the branches or from the ground in autumn. Harvest the hard, dark brown seeds for making coffee then too, if desired.</field>
      <field name="cooking">You can use the tender, very young seedpods like snow peas, cooked in stir-fry recipes, soups, or stews, early in the summer. After they've developed in mid-summer, the immature, green seeds taste like a combination of green peas and beans. You can eat them raw or cook them like green peas in any recipe where peas are suitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sweet pulp inside the mature, reddish-brown seedpods smells and tastes like bananas. Although people used it in beer-making and to sweeten beverages, the pods are hard to split in half, especially in the northern states, and there's usually not enough hard-to-extract pulp to do much more than use it as a tasty trail nibble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have also roasted and ground the mature seeds, and used them as a caffeine-free coffee substitute.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Very few edible wild plants have enough calories or protein to make survivalists happy, but this tree is an exception. The seeds contain sugar, protein, and fat, as well as calcium, and phosphorus. The yellow-green pulp obviously contains sugar, but other nutrients in this and the remaining edible parts of the tree not been analyzed.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">An infusion of the immature pods has been used of indigestion, measles, and nasal congestion, and its juice has some antiseptic activity. Since the immature pods are edible, this should be safe, even if it doesn't work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An extract of the mature pods also showed activity against cancer cells, but with severe side effects. A decoction of the cambium has been used for whooping cough, measles, and smallpox, but it contains the toxic alkaloids gleditschine and stenocarpine, so these parts are off-limits as home remedies.</field>

Although the pulp and raw seeds are poisonous, the two species are also easy to tell apart.</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Wisteria has feather-compound leaves and seedpods, but it's a vine, not a tree, and has showy, edible, blue to violet flowers.

      <field name="range">Most of the eastern half of North America plus Utah, with similar edible relatives in the Southwest and West Coast.</field>

      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a large tree with dark brown, ropey bark, long, finely toothed, feather-compound leaves usually lacking terminal leaflets and inconspicuous, drooping, green catkins. The hard-shelled walnuts are inside a spherical, green husk in the tree or on the ground. Keep an eye out for old walnut shells on the ground.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This majestic tree, with a crown spread of 70 feet, grows 50 to 130 feet tall, with a trunk one to four feet in diameter, and no branches near the bottom. The dark brown, deeply furrowed, ropey looking, ridged bark creates diamond patterns. Wooly, whitish buds, rounded at the tips, grow from 0.33 to 0.5 inch long, at the tips of the stout, smooth, greenish brown to gray twigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alternate, feather-compound leaves, one to two feet long, include ten to 24 lance-shaped, narrow, finely toothed, lemon-scented, unevenly-paired leaflets, each three to five inches long and about one inch broad, with pointed tips and uneven bases. Pale green above and downy below, but turning yellow in autumn, the largest leaflets grow toward the leaf's center, usually without a terminal leaflet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spring, tiny, green, inconspicuous male flowers grow on long, slender, green catkins three to four inches long, hanging from the branches and releasing pollen into the wind just before the young leaves become large enough block it. The small, inconspicuous, green, pear-shaped, Y-tipped female flowers grow in terminal clusters of two to five at the tips of the branches then too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ripening in mid-autumn, the spherical, lemony-scented, semi-fleshy fruits two to 2.5 inches across, growing singly or in tight groups of up to four, look like crinkly, green tennis balls. As autumn progresses, the thick husk turns yellow, then blackens as it's consumed by insects. Inside the husk, a hard, furrowed black nutshell 1.5 inches across encloses the bilaterally symmetrical nutmeat, which looks like that of the commercial or English walnut (&lt;i&gt;J. regia&lt;/i&gt;). Nutshell fragments persist on the ground under the tree all year.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Tree 50 to 130 feet tall, trunk one to four feet across, and crown spread of 70 feet&lt;br /&gt;•Dark brown, deeply furrowed, ropey looking, ridged bark with diamond patterns&lt;br /&gt;•Lemon-scented, alternate, feather-compound leaves, one to two feet long&lt;br /&gt;•Ten to 24 unevenly-paired, finely toothed, lance-shaped leaflets three to five inches long and about one inch broad&lt;br /&gt;•Leaflets pale green above and downy below, with pointed tips and uneven bases&lt;br /&gt;•Largest leaflets toward leaf center&lt;br /&gt;•Terminal leaflet usually absent&lt;br /&gt;•Tiny, green, inconspicuous male flowers on slender, drooping, terminal green catkins 3 to 4 inches long&lt;br /&gt;•Two to five small, inconspicuous, pear-shaped, Y-tipped female flowers in terminal clusters&lt;br /&gt;•Spherical, corrugated, lemony-scented, semi-fleshy fruits two to 2.5 inches across, solitary or in tight groups of up to four&lt;br /&gt;•Fruit color changing from green to yellow to black&lt;br /&gt;•Hard, furrowed, black nutshell 1.5 inches across, enclosing bilaterally symmetrical nutmeat</field>
      <field name="harvesting">The husks can dye your hands brown for a few days unless you may wear rubber gloves, but if you don't remove the husks soon, the maggots that live in them will bore through the nutshells and ruin the nuts. Roll off the black walnut’s green husk underfoot on a hard surface such as a pavement, wearing old shoes. Some people strike the husk the butt of a baseball bat, and some cut a walnut-sized hole in a plywood board and whack the nut through with a hammer, so the husk remains behind. Others run over the nuts with a car, but this cracks the nutshells and reduces the nut's shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the husk is removed, you can smash open the shell with a heavy rock on a level pavement, (so they don't roll away) or on a flat rock, pick out the moist nutmeat (bring a nutpick), and enjoy the nuts in the field. But if you take the nuts home and spread them on newspapers to dry out, their flavor and texture improves, and they'll no longer stain your hands. The dry nuts will keep indefinitely in their shells, but once you've shelled them, freeze any you don't use within a few days, so the perishable oils don't begin to become rancid.</field>
      <field name="cooking">A hard nut to crack, you can open the nuts at home with a heavy hammer, a vice or a heavy duty nutcracker (a regular nutcracker is too weak). I got mine from C.E. Potter, Sapula, Oklahoma 74066, (918) 224-0567. (A technophobe, Mr. Potter has no website or even voice mail!) Other black walnut crackers are available online too, but I haven't tried them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover the nut with a clean rag before you crack it, or the pieces will fly across the room. Use a nutpick (also called a lobster pick), available in hardware stores, to remove the nutmeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black walnuts taste stronger and richer than the commercial walnuts, a little like very savory commercial walnuts plus wine and mushrooms. Use the nuts raw, or roast them 30 minutes in a 300°F oven, shelled or unshelled, stirring occasionally. Add small amounts in cereals, granola, cakes, pies, pasta, pesto, stuffing, casseroles, or mixed into peanut butter. Too many may overpower the other ingredients, although mixing 1 part black walnuts with 3 parts commercial walnuts alleviates this problem. You can also grind raw black walnuts into a meal and add this to flour for any kind of baking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black walnut oil, which you can get by boiling the shelled nuts and skimming the oil from the surface of the water, is great mixed with milder oils in salad dressing, or for cooking, but it's labor-intensive to make, and I'd rather eat my hard-earned walnuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have allegedly pickled the excess immature walnuts that the tree drops in the summer, to lighten its load (trees often begin with an excess of fruit, then drop some undeveloped ones to give the rest a better chance of developing fully), by boiling them in vinegar with salt and pickling spices, until a pin can pass through them. I've never gotten this to work, though. Perhaps it only works with commercial walnuts, which have thinner shells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have also tapped black walnut trees in early spring, like maple trees. You have to boil the sap to 1/4th of its volume to make the syrup—enough processing to destroy any nutrients—and you can't do this indoors without all the steam making the paint peeling off your walls!</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Black walnuts are packed with important nutrients, including protein and carbohydrates; vitamin B1, B2, B3, and E; the minerals iron, magnesium, and potassium; and the fatty acids linolenic, linoleic, palmytic, stearic, and oleic acid.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Black walnuts contain alkaloids with demonstrated anti-cancer properties, although the research that led to this discovery were discontinued prematurely years ago when funding ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decoction of boiled husks, which contain tannin, juglandin, juglone, and juglandic acid, has been used internally to kill parasites. Someone should try it on a lawyer or politician to see if it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A compress of the decoction successfully treats athlete’s foot, ringworm and other fungal infections of the skin. It's also been used for herpes and eczema, although there's no convincing evidence that it's effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decoction of the cambium has been used for diarrhea and to stop milk production, but it can cause vomiting, so it should be avoided. And an infusion of the leaves has been used to lower high blood pressure, something that could easily be tested with a blood pressure monitoring device.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">0</field>
      <field name="cautions">The fresh husk of the black walnut will stain your hands brown for a few days, especially if you have light-colored skin, although swimming in a chlorinated pool speeds recovery.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">The black walnut has similar-looking, edible close relatives that cover much of the US: The California walnut (&lt;i&gt;J. californica&lt;/i&gt;) grows in southern California, while the northern California walnut (&lt;i&gt;J. hindsii&lt;/i&gt;) grows in the northern part of the state. The Texas walnut (&lt;i&gt;J. microcarpa&lt;/i&gt;), interbreeds with the black walnut in TX where their ranges overlap, and the Arizona walnut (&lt;i&gt;J. major&lt;/i&gt;) grows along streams and washes in the Southwest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other related and unrelated trees with feather-compound leaves are easier to distinguish:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closely related butternut tree (&lt;i&gt;J. cinerea&lt;/i&gt;) resembles the black walnut tree, but this Eastern relative has light gray bark with flat ridges. There's usually a terminal leaflet, and the edible, green-husked nut is lemon-shaped, not spherical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hickory trees (&lt;i&gt;Carya spp.&lt;/i&gt;), more distant relatives, have shorter feather-compound leaves with fewer leaflets, bark without large ridges and furrows, and smaller nuts with husks that partially split into four sections. Some, but not all species, have delicious nuts, although the nuts of one common variety taste worse than [-my] the school lunch I remember!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unrelated Kentucky coffee-tree's (&lt;i&gt;Gymnnocladis dioca&lt;/i&gt;) feather-compound leaves are twice-divided. This source of caffeine-free coffee has dark, grayish brown, scaly bark that develops deep furrows with scaly ridges, and its fruit is a thick, black, bean-like seedpod containing seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feather-compound leaves of the non-edible unrelated ailanthus tree or tree-of-heaven (&lt;i&gt;Ailanthus altissimus&lt;/i&gt;) smell of rotten peanut butter, not lemons. They have terminal leaflets, rough, gray bark without ridges or furrows, and key-like samaras, similar to those of maple trees, instead of nuts.</field>

      <field name="season">Butternuts fall to the ground in late summer and early fall.</field>
      <field name="habitat">This tree grows in full sunlight in fertile, moist, well-drained soil, with little tolerance of shade. Look for it in forests of mixed hardwoods, along stream banks, near coves, on slopes and terraces, in open parklands, and around the talus (broken rock) of ledges.</field>
      <field name="range">Most of Eastern North America, excluding Florida and Louisiana</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin"></field>
      <field name="native">1</field>



      <field name="harvesting">Just pick up the butternuts from the ground under the tree. If grass is hiding them, walk in a grid pattern to cover the entire area under the tree, shuffling your feet, to detect by touch those nuts you don't see. If the tree is healthy and weather conditions are decent, you can get a good crop every two or three years, with a light crop (sometimes none) other years.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The butternut has a light, sweet, smoky flavor. After you collect butternuts, don’t remove the husks, as some foraging authors suggest—it's a huge amount of unnecessary work. Dry the nuts in a food dehydrator—very inexpensive on eBay nowadays. The husks turn brown shrink to nothing, and the nuts ripen and improve in flavor and texture. The dried nuts will last indefinitely instead of perishing in two weeks, and, unlike with the fresh fruits, the husks won't stain your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you can crack the shells with a large rock on a hard surface, or with a vice or hammer, a heavy-duty nutcracker works best (a regular nutcracker is too weak). If the butternut is too long to fit into the nutcracker, clip off the tip with kitchen shears, a wire cutter, or pruning shears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a nutcracker form C.E. Potter, Sapula, Oklahoma 74066, (918) 224-0567. A low-tech person, Mr. Potter has no website or even voice mail, but his nut cracker is excellent, although I've heard that others are just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover the nut with a clean rag before you crack it, or the pieces will fly across the room. Use a nutpick (also called a lobster pick), available in hardware stores, to remove the nutmeat. Freeze any nuts you're not going to use within a few days—their oil goes rancid quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Native Americans  roasted the nuts, boiled the crushed nutmeat, and skimmed off the oil that rose to the surface, which they used like butter, but this is labor-intensive, health food stores sell high-quality vegan butter substitutes, and I'd rather eat or cook with the hard-earned nuts.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Butternuts provide protein, iron, magnesium, and linolenic and linoleic acids. They have the lowest carbohydrate content of all the nuts, only 3%, ideal for people on a low-carb diet.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Native Americans used a decoction of the cambium as a laxative. Low doses are a safe and effective way to treat constipation, although it doesn't address any underlying causes. It was very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, when constipation was a little-remembered major health obsession in the Western world. It's also been used for as a cathartic—part of a dated, heroic approach to herbalism, as well as for liver congestion, rheumatic and arthritic joints, headaches, and dysentery, but without supporting evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A warm compress of the decoction was used to stop wounds from bleeding, and butternut oil has been used to treat ringworm and fungal infections. One  of its constituents, juglone, is an antiseptic and fungicidal that also shows some anti-tumor activity.</field>

This source of caffeine-free coffee has dark, grayish brown, scaly bark that develops deep furrows with scaly ridges, and its fruit is a thick, black, bean-like seedpod contains flattened, disk-shaped seeds, not nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feather-compound leaves of the non-edible unrelated ailanthus tree or tree-of-heaven (&lt;i&gt;Ailanthus altissimus&lt;/i&gt;) smell of rotten peanut butter when crushed, not lemons.

      <field name="habitat">Sunny or shady habitats, deep, rich, moist, well-drained soils, forests, bottom land, upland soil, and park lands.</field>
      <field name="range">The American Beech grows throughout most of Eastern North America plus Utah, but not in Florida or southern Georgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Copper Beach has been planted in parks throughout most of the US and southern Canada.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">The American Beech is native, while the Copper Beach comes from Europe.</field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a large, wide tree with a rounded crown, and stout, horizontal or ascending branches that often touch the ground. The American Beeches have smooth, light gray bark usually covered with graffiti and have small, short-stalked, soft-spined, four-parted burs. The medium-sized leaves are alternate, elliptical, short-stalked, waxy, sparsely toothed, shiny green above and light green below (or copper-colored).</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This large, very wide tree, with smooth, light bark usually defaced with graffiti, grows 60 to 115 feet tall, with a spread of 50 to 70 feet, a dense, rounded crown, stout horizontal or ascending branches, and a trunk two to three feet in diameter. Some of the branches often touch the ground. Long, scaly, cigar-shaped buds, 0.5 inch long, stick out like thorns from the slender, zig-zag twigs from late summer to early spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternate, elliptical, short-stalked, waxy leaves, shiny green above and light green below (sometimes dark green or copper-colored in some cultivated European varieties), grow from two to five inches long and one to three inches wide, with 11 to 14 prominent veins, each ending in a sharp tooth. The leaf base is broad and it's tip pointed. The leaves, which turn yellow or brown on the American species, and copper on the Copper Beech, often persist through the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after the leaves form in the spring, the yellowish male flowers grow packed into spheres up to one inch across, drooping from a hairy, slender stalk. The female flowers, 0.25 inches across, grow paired or in fours. Surrounded by reddish, hairy scales, you'll find them at the tips of short, hairy stems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In autumn, a short-stalked, soft-spined, four-parted bur, 0.5 to 0.75 inch across, encloses two or three small, three-sided, shiny, brown, sharply angled shells, each containing a small, light brown, oily nut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tree produces deep shade, and has dense, shallow roots that absorb all the water under the tree, so no plants can grow under it.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Collect the nuts from the ground after they've fallen out of the husks, or remove the nutshells from the low-hanging husks by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flowers are usually damaged by early frosts, resulting in empty nutshells in the fall, so I've only been able to harvest beechnuts twice from 1982 to 2010, but the two good years provided very large crops.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Beechnuts are among the most delicious of nuts, tasting like a combination of hazelnuts and sunflower seeds. After you remove them from the husks, you can crack the thin shells open with your teeth, like sunflower seeds, or peel them with your fingernails. The nuts are great raw or roasted, shelled or unshelled. Add the shelled nuts to cereals, stuffing, pies, cakes, or other desserts, as you would other nuts. You can roast them before or after shelling in a preheated 300° F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can store beechnuts unroasted and unshelled in a paper bag at room temperature for months. Once you crack the shells, oxygen in the air will make the oil in the nuts rancid. You can store the shelled nuts in a refrigerator for a couple of weeks, or freeze them for long-term storage. </field>
      <field name="nutrition">Beech nuts provide protein, vitamins B1 and B2, calcium, magnesium, and iron, plus high-quality monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses"></field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Some beech trees may contain nuts with some tannin content, making them slightly toxic if eaten in large quantity. I've never come across this, as tannin is bitter, and all the beechnuts I've tried were sweet, but if you notice bitterness, soak the nuts in multiple changes of water to leach out the tannin until the bitterness is gone, or boil the nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to stumble over a young tree while collecting nuts from the vicinity of its parent tree. It might be a son-of-a-beech!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">The American and European copper beech are very similar, and foragers can use them identically. The copper beech's leaves turn copper- or reddish-brown in fall. It's the species most commonly planted in parks, whereas the American species is more common in wilder forested areas.</field>

      <field name="nutrition">Chestnuts contain lots of calories in the form of carbohydrates, plenty of potassium, moderate amounts of phosphorus and calcium, and some protein and iron. They contain less oil than any other nut, and they’re easy to digest.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Native Americans used a decoction of the cambium as a cough syrup, and for whooping cough and heart disease. They also dried the cambium and used it as a powder for chafed skin. An infusion of the leaves was used both to calm the respiratory nerves and as an expectorant. However, there are indications that the herb is simply a mild astringent, and it's not used medicinally today.</field>

      <field name="similarPlants">Cultivated and abandoned Chinese chestnut trees &lt;i&gt;(C. mollissima)&lt;/i&gt; and other close relatives grow in residential areas and woodlands throughout the United States. They're hard to tell apart from the native species, although they become full-grown trees, not sickly looking branches arising from stumps. Otherwise, the clearest difference is that American chestnut tree's twigs are hairless, and the other species' are hairy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eastern chinquapin (&lt;i&gt;C. pumila&lt;/i&gt;) is a shrub or small tree similar to the American chestnut tree, but no more than 10 to 25 feet tall. The bark is light reddish-brown, and the young twigs are densely hairy. Whitish and hairy beneath, the coarsely-toothed, alternate, lance-shaped, simple leaves grow up to 5 inches long and 2 inches wide. Tiny, inconspicuous, beige flowers grow on long, narrow spikes in the spring, and burr-like husks grow  just under 0.5 inches across, smaller than chestnuts', with just 1 edible nut that's not flattened per husk. Growing in dry woods and thickets in the Southeast and north to NJ, they’re occasionally cultivated throughout the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bush chinquapin (&lt;i&gt;C. sempervirens&lt;/i&gt;) is a similar evergreen shrub of the Pacific Northwest, with one to three nuts encased in each spiny bur. All these species have edible nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chestnut oak (&lt;i&gt;Quercus prinus&lt;/i&gt;) has leaves that look like the chestnut's, but with rounded lobes on their margins, not pointed teeth like the chestnut's leaves. And it produces edible acorns, but no chestnuts.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="slug">gingko-tree</field>


      <field name="group">Family: &lt;i&gt;Ginkgoaceae&lt;/i&gt;—the gingko tree is the only living member of this otherwise-extinct family</field>
      <field name="plantType"/>
      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">Ginkgo nuts fall to the ground mostly in mid- and late fall, and sometimes some persist through the winter.</field>
      <field name="habitat">A relic from 200 million years ago and thought to be extinct since the Ice Ages, Western botanists were amazed to discover a few cultivated trees in temple gardens in China in 1690. Although they don’t grow in the wild any more, ginkgoes have been planted extensively in parks and along streets, where they need nearly full sunlight. Because their population was so low, and all other members of their genus and order are long gone, their parasites and diseases are extinct too. Only a relic fungus that decomposes the fallen leaves remains. So these trees always remain healthy under the most unfavorable urban conditions.</field>
      <field name="range">This living fossil grows under cultivation throughout North America and the much of the temperate world.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Ginkgoes are native to Laurasia, a supercontinent that no longer exists. Some ginkgoes grow wild in Southern China, but they're so genetically similar to cultivated trees that most botanists think these holdovers of the Triassic Period were introduced into the wild by the Chinese in ancient times.</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a slender, sparsely branched, columnar tree with gray, furrowed bark and alternate, fan-shaped, medium-sized leaves growing in clusters on short, thick, bullet-shaped twigs. Orange, spherical, fleshy, long-stalked, fruit under than one inch across hangs from the branches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, even better, sniff for the fruit's smell of vomit and rotting flesh—detectable (but certainly not delectable) from a block away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Growing from 65 to 115 feet tall with gray, furrowed bark, this tall, slender, straight, columnar, and sparingly branched tree's unique, short, thick, bullet-shaped twigs or spur shoots make it as distinct in the winter as the leaves do at other times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alternate, fan-shaped leaves grow in clusters on short branches or twigs, called spur shoots, along the longer branches, with leaf stalks about three inches long. These mostly notched or lobed leaves, which usually grow from two to four inches across, turn bright yellow in autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike any other living tree, the leaves' raised veins fan out into the leaf blade from its base, repeatedly splitting into two. These spreading, bifurcating veins look like the needles of an ancestral leaf that knit together, like a duck's webbed feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiny, inconspicuous, wind-pollinated flowers hang from the spur branches in short, narrow clusters early spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ripening in autumn, the orange, spherical, fleshy, long-stalked, malodorous fruit grows to less than 1 inch across. Butyric acid (first discovered in rancid butter and present in decaying flesh and other disgusting objects) makes the fruit smell like vomit, and most certainly functioned as a very effective dinosaur repellent.  The single, light brown, woody, thin-shelled, seamed, almond-sized nutshell inside each fruit encloses a soft, greenish, almond-sized, ovate kernel that’s wrapped in a brown, papery membrane.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Slender, sparsely branched, columnar tree with gray, furrowed bark&lt;br /&gt;•Alternate, fan-shaped leaves two to four inches across, growing in clusters on short, thick, bullet-shaped twigs&lt;br /&gt;•Leaves turning yellow in autumn&lt;br /&gt;•Raised leaf veins fanning out from the leaf base, repeatedly splitting into 2&lt;br /&gt;•Tiny, inconspicuous, yellow, wind-pollinated flowers hanging in short, narrow clusters in the spring&lt;br /&gt;•Spherical, orange, fleshy, long-stalked, foul-smelling fruit, growing less than 1 inch across, ripening on female trees in autumn&lt;br /&gt;•Whitish, woody, thin-shelled, seamed, almond-sized nutshell inside the fruit&lt;br /&gt;•One soft, greenish, almond-sized, ovate kernel wrapped in a brown, papery membrane, inside the nutshell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Collect gingko nuts wearing rubber gloves. Some people get a rash from touching the poisonous fruit, which also makes bare hands smell bad. Squeeze the fruit so the nut pops out. Leave the fruit next to the tree trunk, so other foragers won’t confuse it with unopened fruit.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Wearing rubber gloves, rinse the de-fruited nuts thoroughly in a colander, then roast them (the nuts, not the gloves) in an oiled baking dish in a preheated 300° F oven for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The nuts are only edible cooked. Properly cooked gingkos are soft and rich. Undercooked nuts are hard and slightly unpleasant-tasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because all its close and distant relatives are long extinct, gingko nuts taste different from anything you've ever eaten—like a combination of green peas and Limburger cheese—weird at first, then delicious, and perfectly suited to East Asian cuisine, where cheesy-tasting fermented foods are common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too delicate for a nutcracker, crack open the thin-shelled nuts with your teeth, like sunflower seeds, or tap them with an empty water glass. Eat them then and there, or add them to soups, stews, pilafs, stuffings, rice, stir-fry dishes, congee, and other Chinese or East Asian recipes. Combined with fermented-flavored brewer’s yeast or nutritional yeast, they’ll make any vegan dish taste like it contains cheese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To store ginkgoes, freeze them before or after you’ve toasted them, but don’t store refrigerated for more than two days, or they may get as hard as rocks as they dry out. Briefly re-roast them to defrost, and they’ll be perfect.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Ginkgo seeds provide calories, protein, flavonoids, vitamins C, b1, B3, B6, and folate, plus the minerals copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and zinc.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Gingko leaf extract contains many biologically active substances, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ginkgolides, heterosides, and vasodilators. Extracts are prescribed by doctors in Germany for memory problems. Although recent studies on its effects on memory show mixed results, I know it how to make it improve memory without fail: Smell the stinky fruit just once, you'll never forget it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research shows that the extract is good for headache, tinnitus, intermittent claudication, and even depression, possibly because it improves blood flow in the arteries and capillaries. It’s also used for circulatory disorders, headaches, asthma, toxic shock syndrome, bleeding, bruising, asthma, heart and kidney disorders, glucose intolerance, and edema. It contains an analog of platelet activating factor, intervening in the formation of arterial plaques. And it destroys free radicals, which might make it lower the risk of cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Chinese folklore, the fruit is applied as a dressing for wounds. An infusion of the fruit is used for indigestion, and as an expectorant for asthma, bronchitis and tuberculosis. But the fruit is poisonous, both internally and externally, and it’s quite repulsive, so I don't think my advice to avoid it is even necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eating ginkgo nuts is considered very healthful in Chinese traditional medicine (and in Japan), where they're supposed to promote digestion and diminish the effects of excessive alcohol. The nuts may produce similar health benefits to the leaf extract, although this still awaits testing.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Gather the nuts before Asian families, who also appreciate this traditional delicacy and often sell the nuts, get to the trees first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collect ginkgo nuts wearing rubber gloves. Some people get a rash from touching the poisonous fruit, which also makes your hands stink. And don't eat ginkgoes raw—they're poisonous before cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japanese folklore advises eating no more than seven nuts at a time (stuffing eight into your mouth at once would also be bad manners!) I eat dozens with no ill effects, but I do know people who get headaches from eating lots of ginkgoes, and other ginkgo over-eaters experience shortness of breath, either due to an allergy, or from wolfing down too many nuts and neglecting to breathe. Eat very small servings the first time and gradually increase the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't take ginkgo extracts if you're pregnant, nursing, or taking MAO inhibitors or blood-thinning medication.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Some ginkgo trees never produce fruit. Here's why—most modern plants have both male and female flowers on the same individual, but the ginkgo, which goes very far back in time, has separate male and female trees. And unlike human beings, it's the female of the species that has the nuts!</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Hazelnut bushes can produce good crops every two to three years, but I hardly find more than one or two nuts in the bushes or on the ground in my area (Greater NY), possibly because squirrels get them first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collect hazelnuts (wearing gloves for the bristly American species) a little under-ripe, before critters get them, and let them brown, dry, and ripen in storage. </field>
      <field name="cooking">These nuts taste even better than commercial hazelnuts. Crack them with a nutcracker and use them as you would any nuts, raw or cooked. You can also grind them in a food processor or blender and use the meal along with whole-grain flours in baking—especially good in pie crusts, pastries, and biscuits.

        <field name="slug">czeck-rice-pudding</field>

        <field name="directions">Here’s a classic dessert that Czecks top with fresh fruit. Use fresh wild berries if they’re in season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual with my vegan cooking discoveries, liquid stevia handily replaces sugar, and lecithin granules take over from egg yolks. Sweet brown rice, much more healthful than refined white rice, has just the flavor and texture qualities you want for desserts, and the flavoring extracts complement the traditional hazelnuts perfectly. Czech it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 cups sweet brown rice&lt;br /&gt;4 cups almond milk or other non-dairy milk&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup elderberries or other seasonal berries&lt;br /&gt;1/4  cup raisins or currants&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup hazelnuts or almonds, chopped&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup lecithin granules&lt;br /&gt;2 tbs. hazelnut oil or almond oil&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp. almond extract&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp. amaretto extract (optional)&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp. orange extract&lt;br /&gt;2 drops bitter almond extract or 1 tsp. almond extract&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp. salt&lt;br /&gt;2 cups of any fresh berries, or 2 cups of other chopped fruit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Mix all ingredients except the fresh berries and bake in an oiled casserole dish, uncovered, 2 hours or until all the liquid is absorbed and the pudding is lightly browned, in a preheated 400 degree F oven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.

      <field name="slug">hickory-trees</field>


      <field name="group">&lt;i&gt;Juglandaceae&lt;/i&gt;, the walnut family or the hickory family</field>
      <field name="plantType"/>
      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">Hickory nuts ripen from early- to mid-fall, although you can sometimes still find some intact nuts on the ground in late fall. A good crop occurs only once every two or three years for most species, which is why only the more reliable pecan is grown commercially.</field>
      <field name="habitat">You can find hickories in full sun or partial shade, in a wide variety of woodland habitats such as rich, open woodlands, bottomlands, dry, upland slopes, and on well-drained soil in lowlands and valleys.</field>
      <field name="range">Most hickory trees species grow throughout most of Eastern North America, but the pecan grows only in the Southern Mississippi Basin and the Southeast.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin"></field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for tall, narrow trees with fragrant, alternate, feather-compound leaves consisting of five to seven opposite, lance-shaped to elliptical, toothed leaflets that turn yellow in autumn. Tiny, green male flowers hang from long catkins. Spikes of small female flowers grow from the branches' tips and spherical, green, four-parted husks contain ovate or rounded nuts.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">These common woodland trees grow from 60 to 180 feet tall. Fragrant, alternate, feather-compound leaves with five to seven opposite, lance-shaped to elliptical, toothed leaflets that turn yellow in autumn, grow from eight to 30 inches long. In springtime, tiny, green male flowers hang from long catkins, while small spikes of female flowers hide at the branches' tips. Hickory trees drop nuts inside distinctive, spherical, four-parted green husks, 0.5 to 1.5 inches in diameter, in autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have about 24 species native to Eastern North America (one more grows in China!), too many to cover them all individually, especially since they can hybridize, but they're all similar enough for you to recognize them all as hickories. Many species have delicious nuts, and although a few have nuts too bitter to eat, none is poisonous. Here are a few of the most common ones:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing from 60 to 120 feet tall (sometimes up to 180 feet) with a straight trunk and cylindrical shape, the shagbark hickory's (&lt;i&gt;C. ovata&lt;/i&gt;) light gray bark looks shaggy when mature, with long, flat, vertical slabs curling away from the trunk in long. This makes it one of the easiest trees to recognize, even in the winter. Eight to 14 inches long, the leaves usually have five to seven apple-scented leaflets four to six inches long and about 2 inches wide. The leaflets near the leaf base are the smallest. The male catkins hang from four to six inches long, while the female flowers grow on short spikes 0.3 inches long. The nuts grow singly or in twos or threes. As it matures, the spherical, thick husk, two inches across, changes from green to yellow-green, then to black. The thin-shelled, light tan, ovate nutshell, one to 1.5 inches across, encloses a sweet nut, which I think is the best of the hickories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The less common shellbark hickory (&lt;i&gt;C. laciniosa&lt;/i&gt;) is similar to the shagbark, but with less curly bark and nine to 17 leaflets per leaf, while the water hickory (&lt;i&gt;C. aquatica&lt;/i&gt;), also similar, has seven to nine leaflets. Foragers can treat all three of these species identically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mockernut hickory (&lt;i&gt;C. tomentosa&lt;/i&gt;), which usually grows 50 to 60 (sometimes 100) feet tall with a straight stem and a rounded crown, has dark-gray, tight, furrowed bark, creating a diamond pattern, and dense hair under the twigs.  The leaves grow six to 12 inches long, with five to nine leaflets up to eight inches long. Their undersides and the central axis are densely woolly. The ovoid to ellipsoid nut, 1.5 to two inches long, has a thinner husk than the shagbark hickory, and a thick, hard (&lt;i&gt;mockernut&lt;/i&gt; means heavy-hammer nut in Dutch), light tan, four-ribbed shell. The tasty nut is harder to remove from its convoluted shell than the shagbark, but quite tasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aptly named pignut hickory (&lt;i&gt;C. glabra&lt;/i&gt;) usually grows from 60 to 80 (sometimes 100) feet tall and ten to 40 inches wide, with a crown 25 to 35 feet wide, a cylindrical shape, gray-brown, shallow-ridged, furrowed bark creating a diamond pattern, and stout stems. The leaves grow eight to 12 inches long, with five to seven finely toothed, hairless, lance-shaped leaflets 2.5 to five inches long and one to two inches wide. The terminal leaflet is the largest. The male catkins grow in clusters of three from short spurs near the young twigs' tips. The thin, dark brown, pear-shaped husk grows one to two inches long and about 0.75 inch across, with a thick-shelled, somewhat flattened nut about one inch across inside.  You’ll love the nutmeat inside, but only if you’re a pig! It's usually fiercely bitter, full of tannin. I’ve heard of a few individual pignut trees with tasty nuts, but I’ve never found one after 29 years of foraging in the Greater NY region, though you might fare better elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bitternut or yellowbud hickory (&lt;i&gt;C. cordiformis&lt;/i&gt;) grows from 60 to 100 feet tall, with a cylindrical, irregular crown up to 25 feet wide, and a trunk 1.5 to three feet across, with shallowly ridged, gray bark, and distinctive, powdery, sulfur-yellow buds. The three to five inch long male catkins grow in threes. The leaf grows seven to 14 inches long, with five to nine sharply toothed, stalkless leaflets. Because the four narrow ridges of the husk's ridges extend from the outer tip inward to between 0.5 and 0.33 of the fruit's length, only the bottom half of the thin husk, which grows from one to 1.5 inches across, splits open, revealing a rounded, beaked, cream-colored, smooth, thin-shelled nut shell one inch in diameter, with a reddish-coated kernel, again way to bitter to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pecan (C. illinoensis) has dark, reddish-brown bark broken into vertical ridges. The leaves, 12 to 30 inches long, include nine to 17 lance-shaped, glossy, unsymmetrical leaflets with recurved tips. The oblong, smooth, thin-shelled nuts, over one inch long, have distinct ridges. The tree and tasty nuts quite similar to commercial pecans.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Simply pick the nuts up off the ground while the husks are still green, and before insects or other critters get to them. You can pry the husks in the field or at home with your fingers or with a screwdriver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to eat the nuts in the field, place them on a hard, flat surface and crack them with a large rock. Be careful not to smash them to bits. If you bring a nutpick (also called a lobster pick), removing the nutmeat will be easier.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Store hickory nuts in paper bags until the husks dry and open, releasing the mature nuts. Unshelled nuts keep indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’ll need a large rock, hammer, vice, or special nutcracker to open the hard shell, and a nutpick to remove the nutmeat. I use a nutcracker from C.E. Potter, Sapula, Oklahoma 74066, (918) 224-0567. A low-tech person, Mr. Potter has no website or even voice mail, but his nut cracker is excellent, although I've heard that others are just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Store shelled nuts, refrigerated, in closed containers and use them within a few weeks, or freeze them. Use them like any other nuts, raw or roasted. Add them to pies, cakes, pudding, granola, ice cream, salads, or stuffing, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've read that mashing and boiling nuts that are too bitter to eat releases high-quality oil you can skim off the water's surface. Since the bitter tannin is water-soluble and not fat-soluble, it can’t affect the oil. Great in theory, but after three hours collecting, de-husking, and smashing large quantities of bitternuts to bits with a mallet, and more hours of boiling and stirring, just a few specks of oil dotted the water's surface! I haven't tried this with the edible species—the temptation to eat or cook the nuts, rather than risk wasting them, is simply too great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also tap shagbark hickory trees in late winter, like maple trees, boil down the sap to 1/40th its volume, and make a syrup that's like maple syrup, but with a smoked hickory flavor.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">0.66 of the shelled nut’s dry weight is a high-quality, easily digestible oil, including the high-quality essential fatty acids shown to prevent heart disease. High in calories, hickory nuts also provide protein, carbohydrates, vitamins A and C, iron phosphorus, potassium, and trace minerals.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Although new growth of young leaves have been steamed to make an inhalant for headaches, and the cambium has been used for arthritis, internally as decoction and externally as a poultice, there's no evidence that it works, and it's not currently used in herbal medicine.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions"></field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Of the many species of hickories, it's those with long, flat, curled strips of bark that provide the best nuts for foragers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hickory trees somewhat resemble their edible relatives, the black walnut tree and the butternut tree, but those have longer leaves with more leaflets, and their husks don't split into four (or any) parts.</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">Long, lobed leaves and cupped acorns make these large, familiar trees, which grow from 12 to 120 feet tall, quite distinct. The simple, alternate, long-oval, blunt-edged or pointy tipped leaves are usually partially divided lengthwise into lobes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiny yellow male flowers grow on long, narrow drooping catkins that hang from the twigs in early- or mid-spring. They release large amounts of highly allergenic pollen into the wind while the immature leaves are still too small to block it. The inconspicuous female flowers grow on much smaller spikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ovate, thin-shelled nuts surrounded by cups ripen in autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oak trees generally fall into two groups:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The white oaks have blunt-tipped leaves. Their acorns take one year to mature, and the nutshells are hairless inside. Their acorns are usually the best to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The red oaks have pointy tips on their leaves’ lobes. Their acorns take two years to mature, and the nutshells are hairy inside. Their acorns are usually much more difficult to process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acorns from trees within the white oak group are usually the best for foragers, although there can always be exceptions. This group comprises many species, often hard to distinguish from each other, and they can sometime hybridize. Here are a few of the best: [Again here I've grouped the information by tree]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best-known member of the white oak group is the white oak tree (&lt;i&gt;Q. alba&lt;/i&gt;) itself. It grows from 60 to 120 feet tall with light gray, somewhat furrowed, slightly scaly, flat-ridged bark, a rounded crown, and branches that extend horizontally. Dark glossy-green above, sometimes slightly downy underneath, the blunt-edged leaves grow from five to nine inches long and two to four inches wide, with seven to ten shallow or deep, even, rounded lobes. The male flower catkins grow two to four inches long, while the female flowers are short, single, reddish-green spikes. Long-ovate, light brown when mature, and with a bowl-shaped cup covering up to 0.33 of the nut, the usually stemless acorns grow less than two inches. It's nuts are wonderful when processed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chestnut oak or rock oak (&lt;i&gt;Q. prinus&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Q. montana&lt;/i&gt;) is a medium-size tree, usually 60 to 70 feet tall with a 60 to 70 foot spread. The thick, deeply furrowed reddish-brown to dark brown bark features long, tight ridges that make it look like alligator hide. With wavy margins, the coarsely toothed, elliptical to oblong leaves, dark green above and light green with fine fuzz below, resemble chestnut leaves. They grow five to ten inches long and 3 to 4.5 inches wide. The acorns, which grow singly or paired and reach one to 1.5 inches long, are enclosed by the cup that covers 0.33 of their length. These large, mild-tasting nuts are among the best for eating, and require little if any leaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gambel’s oak (&lt;i&gt;Q. gambelii&lt;/i&gt;) is a shrub or small tree ten to 60 feet tall, with grayish-brown, scaly bark. Dark green and glossy above, lighter and softly fuzzy beneath, the leaves, which have seven to 11 moderate to deep lobes, grow from three to six inches long and two to three inches wide. The spherical acorns grow 0.5 to 0.75 inch long. Their cups enclose 0.25 to 0.75% of them, and they grow singly or paired. They contain so little tannin, some people eat the nuts unprocessed.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Usually tall trees with long leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Leaves simple, alternate, long-oval, blunt-edged or pointy tipped&lt;br /&gt;•Leaves usually partially divided lengthwise into lobes&lt;br /&gt;•Tiny yellow male flowers growing on long, narrow catkins hanging from the twigs&lt;br /&gt;•Small, inconspicuous spikes of female flowers&lt;br /&gt;•Ovate, thin-shelled, cupped nuts </field>
      <field name="harvesting">Collect acorns from the ground as soon as possible after they fall, before they become infested with insects or begin to sprout. Discard any acorns with tiny holes, which will be infested. Insect infestation is greater in some regions, and during some years, than others.</field>
      <field name="cooking">To shell acorns, boil them 1 minute to loosen their shells, split them with a paring knife, and either peel off the shell with your fingers, or scoop out the nutmeat with a nutpick or a grapefruit spoon. Discard any that have rotten sections inside. There's also an acorn sheller you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acorns usually contain too much tannin to eat as is, especially the red oak species, but this bitter substance, which becomes toxic if ingested repeatedly, is water-soluble. You can either leach out the tannin or boil it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To leach the tannin out, 1 way is to chop the shelled acorns to the size of rice grains in a blender with enough water to grind evenly first. This increases the acorns' surface area and speeds up the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Native Americans tied acorns into a weighted sack and submerged this in a river or stream—one way to do cold-water leaching. This clears the tannin in 2 weeks, even with high-tannin red oak acorns. They'd also bury red oak acorns and leave them for months, which reportedly worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't have an unpolluted river handy? Some toilets have a tank of clean water well above the toilet bowl—ideal for leaching acorns. Unfortunately, the tannin will blacken the toiled bowl. For some reason, my wife, who's as much into home remodeling as foraging, isn't thrilled with this method, but if The Home Decorating Channel ever comes up with an Elegant Primitive Living series, I may yet get my chance. (I could try it anyway, and if she complains, just explain that I forgot to flush!)]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another method consists of submerging the chopped acorns in a large bowl of cold water for a few hours, than rinsing and replacing the water until the acorns no longer taste bitter, and there isn't enough tannin being produced to turn the water brown anymore. This can take many days or even weeks with low-tannin white oak acorns, and months or more with high-tannin red oaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot water leaching if faster: Boil the chopped acorns for 20 to 60 minutes, rinse, and re-boil repeatedly until the acorns no longer taste bitter and there isn't enough tannin left to turn the water brown. The last time I did this with white oak acorns, it took the better part of a day, but it was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although hot-water leaching is faster for low-tannin acorns (it didn't work for me with red oak acorns, even after days of boiling), it removes the acorns' starch, and hence their ability to gel, a property used to make a Korean pudding called dotorimuk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 29 years of leading foraging tours, I found a 3rd way to leach much of the tannin out of high tannin red oak acorns: just let winter do most of the work for you! White oak acorns are very perishable, even in the refrigerator, but red oak acorns seem to last much longer. Thus, when my tour participants and I tasted some red oak acorns recently released from the ice and snow of an exceptionally cold and snowy winter (early March in southern Connecticut in 2011), we could barely detect the tannin, and a little boiling should have leached out the remainder. This probably doesn't always work, but if you find acorns that haven't gone bad at the end of winter, give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the nutty flavor and texture of chestnuts but less sweet, leeched acorns make a versatile culinary ingredient. Native Americans discovered that they're an excellent addition to soups and stews. You can use them in mock meat loaves and stuffing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've boiled them in water with curry powder, lemon juice, garlic, seasoned salt, chili paste or hot sauce, and a little olive oil; drained them, added more curry powder, seasoned salt, lemon juice, olive and chili paste, then baked them in a roasting pan until chewy. I call these curried acorns Park Nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can dry leached acorns in a food dehydrator, then grind them into a powder in a blender or spice grinder. They make an excellent flour—nutty flavored and hearty. The flour doesn't rise, but you can mix it with flours that do, or use it in recipes that don't need leavening, like crepes, sauces, or flatbreads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the nuts, young, partially developed white oak leaves make an outstanding wild wine, and you can roast the leached acorns until black, grind them, and use them to make a coffee substitute.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Acorns provide protein, fat, vitamind B3 and B6, folate, and pantothenic acid, plus the minerals calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, copper, and manganese.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Native Americans and Europeans made a bitter decoction from the white oak’s cambium and use it for diarrhea, as a gargle for sore throat, and as a douche for yeast infections. It’s a good wash for skin ulcers, ringworm, and other fungal skin infections, and a cold compress is good for cuts and burns. People have also inhaled the dried, powered cambium like snuff for nosebleeds.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Most acorns contain the bitter polyphenolic compound tannin, as well as gallic acid and ellagitannin. Tannin is astringent, antiseptic and anti-viral, with both anti-tumor and carcinogenic activity. Although present in commercial Chinese tea, long-term intake is unhealthful—contributing to constipation and interfering with calcium absorption. Prolonged high doses can cause kidney damage. Make sure you've prepared acorns as directed, and that you've removed this easily detectable, bitter-tasting substance when present.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">The group of oak species with blunt-tipped leaves is called the white oak, and within that group there's also a species called the white oak. It's helpful to differentiate between the group and the species that share the same name.</field>

        <field name="directions">Here’s one of the weirdest wild food experiments I’ve ever conducted, making wine from oak leaves. I was completely astonished when it resulted in a superb wine that you can use as a table wine, in place of white wine, or for virtually any savory recipe that calls for wine. The flavor is robust but not overpowering, and it's very satisfying. The secret is using very young white oak leaves, before they develop a high tannin content.	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 gallon boiling water&lt;br /&gt;1 gallon immature white oak tree leaves or leaves of other members of the white oak group, gathered just before the leaves have reach full size.&lt;br /&gt;7 cups sugar&lt;br /&gt;The juice of 1 lemon&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup juniper berries&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup fennel seed&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup celery seed&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp. champagne yeast or other wine yeast	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Dissolve the sugar in the water in a non-metal (plastic or ceramic) food container and add the oak leaves and spices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. When cooled to lukewarm, stir in yeast and cover with a non-airtight cover, cheesecloth, or towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Allow to ferment a week at room temperature, stirring twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Strain through a cheesecloth, transfer the liquid to a jug, and seal with an airlock stopper (which lets carbon dioxide bubbles escape but keeps oxygen out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. When fermentation ends a few weeks later, seal the jar with stopper and age 2 to 6 months (taste it to determine if it’s ready) before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Siphon the wine to get rid of the sediment if desired.	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes 1 gallon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparation time: 30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fermentation time: 2 months to 6 months</field>

      <field name="season">The best time for the young greens is in mid-spring, and fall if new greens are coming up. Older leaves are coarse and bitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flowers and the tender, young seedpods are in season from mid- to late summer, and the taproot's good to eat in the spring and fall.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Sunny, dry, and sandy soil, disturbed habitats, neglected gardens, roadsides, and fields—both inland and near the seashore, and in orchards</field>
      <field name="range">Most of the US and most of southern Canada</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Eurasia</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a medium-sized, erect, coarsely hairy plant, usually branching toward the top, with elliptical, lobed or feather-compound basal leaves and similar, alternate stem leaves; stalked, four-petaled, white, yellow, or pale purplish pink flowers, sometimes darkly veined, at the tips of terminal racemes; and long, nearly straight, beaked, segmented seedpods containing for to ten minutes, round to ovate seeds. Feel for the texture of sandpaper.</field>


      <field name="harvesting">Strip off the young leaves, flowers, and seedpods with your hands or fingers, and dig up the taproot with a shovel if you can't pull it up.</field>
      <field name="cooking">This spicy plant tastes like commercial radishes. Too hairy to enjoy raw, you can cook the pungent young leaves in soups and stews. Parboil them for a minute if they're too strong-tasting for you. The old leaves are too bitter and coarse to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flowers and the tender, young seedpods make great garnishes, and you can also cook them in any savory recipe. It takes 5 to 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roots have a hard rind that you must peel off. The tender core tastes like turnips, edible sliced raw into salads or cooked 10 to 15 minutes in a wide variety of appropriate dishes that include vegetables. The seeds, while edible, are too small for practical use.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Commercial radishes, especially the leaves, are a good source of vitamin A, B1, B2, B3, B5, B, C, K, and folate, and as well as the minerals calcium, iron magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium, plus the trace minerals copper, fluoride, selenium, and zinc. They're a good source of protein, carbohydrate, and omega-3 and -6 fatty acids. It stands to reason that wild radishes provide the similar nutrients, possibly in higher concentrations. As a member of the mustard family, the wild radish probably contains beneficial antioxidants too.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Wild radish was supposed to be good for arthritis—taken internally and applied externally in ancient Egypt, when it was very popular, but not currently used medicinally.</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">This pioneer plant of seashore habitats has erect to prostrate, zig-zag, branching, succulent stems 0.5 to 20 inches tall.

      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">The best time to collect wild thyme is from mid-spring to mid-fall. Because it's evergreen, you could also collect it from late fall through early spring. Although it's in a pretty sorry state then, it's still usable, at least for making tea.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Full sunlight, in fields, along roadsides, on poor or rocky soil, on hillsides and mountains, in dry places, and in disturbed habitats </field>
      <field name="range">Scattered among some of the states of Eastern North America and the Pacific Northwest, and in parts of Eastern Canada</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Europe and North Africa</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a dense mat of sprawling, downy, fragrant plants with tiny, elliptical, opposite leaves. The bilaterally symmetrical, two-lipped, tubular flowers flowers grow in dense whorls of lilac, pink-purple, magenta, or rarely white. Wild thyme enjoys growing in full sunlight on generally poor, rocky soil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sniff for the fragrance of thyme as you walk. You might smell the plants if you step on them before you see them.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Woody at the base and forming dense mats, this sprawling, highly branched, downy, evergreen garden escape, which spreads through runners, grows one to three inches tall, and from four inches to one foot long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tiny, fragrant, slightly hairy, opposite, dull gray-green, short-stalked, elliptical, toothless, evergreen leaves grow from 0.25 to 0.5 inch long and 0.12 to 0.25 inch wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dense whorls of very small, fragrant, lilac, pink-purple, magenta, or rarely white, bilaterally symmetrical, two-lipped, tubular  flowers 0.15 to 0.25 inches across, bloom in the summer. They grow on racemes that arise from the tips of the branches and the leaf axils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nearly smooth nutlets contain four small, brown seeds.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Highly branched, downy, sprawling evergreen plant one to three inches tall, forming dense mats, woody at the base&lt;br /&gt;• Tiny, fragrant, slightly hairy, opposite, dull gray-green, short-stalked, elliptical, toothless leaves, 0.25 to 0.5 inch long and 0.12 to 0.25 inch wide&lt;br /&gt;•Dense terminal racemes and racemes arising from leaf axils with short, whorled flower clusters&lt;br /&gt;•Whorls of tiny, fragrant,bilaterally symmetrical, two-lipped, tubular, lilac, pink-purple, magenta, or rarely white flowers, blooming in the summer&lt;br /&gt;•Nearly smooth nutlets containing four small, brown seeds&lt;br /&gt;•Entire plant with strong thyme fragrance</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Strip off the leaves, flowers, and tender portions of the stems with your fingers. If you do this where the plant is growing in its greatest density, you'll be more effective.</field>
      <field name="cooking">With a strong, savory flavor, thyme is a standard culinary seasoning for salads, stews, stuffing, rice, eggs, fish, and pickles, as well as vegetables such as cabbage, eggplant and zucchini. If you're making vegan versions of egg and fish dishes, thyme will make them taste more authentic. Use it fresh or dried, finely chopped or ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make thyme vinegar, simply cover a jar of thyme with vinegar, leave it in the refrigerator for a few days or weeks, then strain it out. It’s great for any recipe that needs some acidity and lots of flavor.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Thyme contains vitamins A, B1, C, and E, as well as the minerals calcium, iron, potassium, and phosphorus, although using it as a seasoning couldn't contribute significantly to your nutrient levels.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Everyone's familiar thyme as a culinary herb, but it's also an important medicinal plant, with a long history of safe use. Considered a tonic, carminative, emmenagogue, and antispasmodic, wild and cultivated thyme contain borneol, fluorine, triterpenic acids, and gum, plus thyme oil, which consists of thymol and cavacrol. Thymol has demonstrated antibiotic, antiseptic, anti-fungal, and anthelmintic properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gargling with a strong, warm infusion of the whole plant will lessen the severity of sore throat. People have also used thyme honey (honey from bees that foraged on thyme flowers) for coughs, sore throats, and even headaches and upset stomachs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A strong infusion of thyme is also used for colds, flu, coughs, bronchitis, laryngitis, colic, hangovers, oral infections, asthma, chronic respiratory problems, sinusitis, mucus congestion, headaches, indigestion, and gas. It's supposed to relax the nervous system—useful for insomnia, nervous disorders, headaches, and depression. As an antispasmodic, it's been used for cramps, spasms, and painful menstruation, as well as for treating uterine muscles following childbirth. And it may even lower HDL (bad cholesterol) levels. It certainly deserves thorough testing, and I wouldn't be surprised if many of the claims prove to be valid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An infusion has been used as a mouthwash, an after-shave lotion, and even an underarm deodorant, probably the best people could come up with before more effective modern alternatives.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Don't use thyme medicinally if you're pregnant. Otherwise, using the infusion for home remedies is safe. However, the concentrated oil, a product created by distillation, can be toxic, and should be administered only competent practitioners.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Common thyme (&lt;i&gt;T. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;), a larger edible relative, grows in Europe, not North America. Lemon thyme (&lt;i&gt;T. pulegioides&lt;/i&gt;), also edible, is another similar but larger European species, recorded as growing in the Northeast, but rare enough that I've never seen it outside of gardens.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Collect the yellow flowers, the white ones usually contain no nectar.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Although you can't use this common vine in recipes, it's been a favorite trail nibble for generations, especially among kids. Pinch off the base of the yellow flowers (the white ones usually have no nectar), taking care not to sever the pistil. Pull the pistil out through the base, and there'll often be a drop of nectar at the pistil's tip that you can lick off. Suck on the base of the empty floral tube and you'll get still more nectar.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">The nectar certainly contains sugar and calories, but only enough to be significant if you're an insect!</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Japanese honeysuckle has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It's used in combination with forsythia (&lt;i&gt;Forsythia suspensa&lt;/i&gt;) in traditional Chinese medicine to "dispel heat," remove toxins, and treat carbuncles, fevers, influenza and ulcers.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Only the nectar from the flowers is safe. The berries are terrible tasting, but weather they're poisonous is still being debated. Some authorities consider them non-poisonous, others claim that they cause vomiting, diarrhea, pupil dilation, cold sweat, rapid heartbeat, respiratory failure, convulsions, coma, and death!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Other vine honeysuckles' (&lt;i&gt;Lonicera spp.&lt;/i&gt;) leaves are fused at the base, forming a perforated leaf. The flowers are non-poisonous, and some of them may have enough nectar for a trail nibble, but they're much less common than Japanese honeysuckle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also bush honeysuckles with similar flowers and berries that are sometimes red. I never find enough nectar to taste in their flowers, and most species have very bitter berries, probably nonpoisonous, although once in a while, you may find an early-fruiting variety with red berries that taste sweet. </field>

You can cook it in recipes that are going to be puréed, i.e., cream soups and sauces. Then it's quite good, with a flavor remarkably like artichokes, and puréeing it in these recipes solves the problem of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You can also dehydrate it, grind it into a powder in a spice grinder, and use it to impart an artichoke flavor to any appropriate recipe, certainly the most unusual of any wild seasoning I've ever made.

      <field name="plantType"/>
      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">The berries are at their best in early fall, before they shrivel and perish in mid-fall, although in some parts of the country they reportedly hang on (literally and figuratively), fresh and edible, into the winter.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Full sun or partial shade, rich, most soil, gravelly or rocky hillsides, woodlands, parks, backyards, empty lots, river banks, rocky barrens, and floodplains.</field>
      <field name="range">The American hackberry grows throughout most of Eastern and Central North America and most of southeastern Canada, but not in VT or LA. Its close relatives, also edible, have overlapping ranges, and they sometime hybridize with each other. The sugarberry, for example, sticks to the Deep South, the dwarf hackberry grows in Eastern North America, and the desert hackberry grows where there's underground water in the deserts of the SW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin"></field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a variably sized tree with a rounded crown, spreading or slightly drooping branches, corky gray bark, and disease-deformed twigs pointing in all directions. The simple, rough, alternate, oval, stalked, dull green, medium-sized, finely toothed, leaves are insect-defaced with asymmetrical bases. Thin-fleshed, solitary, long-stalked, spherical, orange-brown to dark purple berries hang.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Pick the tasty berries with your fingers—labor-intensive but definitely worth the effort. However, the berries are small, so bringing more than one container is definitely not worth the effort.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The thin pulp has sweet flavor similar to the candy coating of M&amp;amp;Ms, but with too little substance for more than a trail nibble. The seeds are good to eat too, if you like the hardness of pebbles (although this may not be true for all the subspecies).</field>
      <field name="nutrition"></field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">A decoction of the cambium and an infusion was used as a gargle for sore throats and pain reliever, and the berries were also used for dysentery, but there's no evidence backing up any of these claims, and this tree isn't currently used in herbal medicine.</field>

      <field name="similarPlants">You can also eat the berries of a number of the American Hackberry's very similar relatives, which hybridize where their ranges overlap: The related Sugarberry (&lt;i&gt;C. laevigata&lt;/i&gt;), which grows in the South, has toothless, more narrow leaves, and the much smaller dwarf hackberry's  (&lt;i&gt;C. tenuifolia&lt;/i&gt;) large, broad leaves lack tooth as well. The desert hackberry’s (&lt;i&gt;C. pallida&lt;/i&gt;) evergreen leaves are only toothed from the middle to the tip, the fruit is yellow to orange, and the twigs are spiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything else you might confuse with hackberry has clustered fruit, whereas hackberries' long-stalked fruits are solitary.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Collect the persimmons from the ground, or shake the tree if it's small enough. Gently pack the delicate fruit into shallow food containers. Separate the ripe ones from the unripe ones, which will ripen off the tree at room temperature, especially if you store them with apples, which give of ethylene gas that hastens ripening. Although persimmons usually ripen when the weather is frosty, contrary to a widespread belief, they doesn't require frost to ripen. Just ask anyone who picks them in Florida!</field>
      <field name="cooking">Smaller and tastier than commercial Asian persimmons, this fruit is only good when it's completely ripe—discolored, blotchy, and spoiled-looking. Use the sweet, pulpy fruit, raw or cooked, in any dessert, from smoothies to ice creams and in cakes, pies, breads, puddings, or pancakes. Avoid attractive-looking, unripe, or even partially ripe fruits, which are unpleasantly astringent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oranges make a perfect complement to persimmons, so I often include orange juice, rind, or extract in persimmon recipes. Lemon is another good complementary flavor, and there's nothing like eating raw persimmons sprinkled with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Remove the seeds with a food mill or your fingers, and the purée is outstanding in any dessert recipe. I use them in pies, cakes, smoothies, ice cream, cookies, cereal, and many other kinds of desserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can freeze American persimmons raw or cooked, and you can steep the leaves to make a tasty herb tea.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Persimmons are one of the most caloric, filling fruits, and an excellent source of vitamin C and D, plus calcium, phosphorous, and potassium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Persimmon leaf infusion is very high in vitamin C, and tasty too.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Native Americans applied cut, unripe persimmons, which may be slightly antiseptic, to burns, where the astringency counteracts the burn's tendency to ooze. They also used this astringency to stop wounds from bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the papaya and pineapple, persimmons contain the digestive enzymes papain and bromelaine—included in digestive enzyme preparations, so eating these fruits should help digestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the American persimmon's most important medicinal use is to cure the talcum-powder-in-the-mouth feeling you get from eating a partially ripe persimmon!</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Don't eat think of eating partially unripe persimmons—they're horribly astringent!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">A closely related edible species of the Southwest, the Texas persimmon (&lt;i&gt;D. texana&lt;/i&gt;) is similar to the American persimmon, but with smooth, gray bark and black fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nonpoisonous blackgum (&lt;i&gt;Nyssa sylvatica&lt;/i&gt;) has glossy leaves with a few teeth, but no persimmon-like fruit, and the leaves turn red in autumn.</field>

      <field name="generalInfo">Growing from three to six feet tall and from six to 12 feet wide, this bramble has many arching or erect, woody, thorny, rounded stems called canes, growing from perennial roots.

      <field name="harvesting">Here's a good way to collect lots of bramble berries with most effectively: Plan your harvest in advance, choosing a relatively cool day, and forage early in the morning, so you can wear long pants and sleeves to protect yourself from thorns and mosquitoes without getting too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punch a hole in the top of a food container, insert a key ring and attach it to your belt with a key clip, to free both hands for picking. Wear heavy-duty work gloves with the fingertips of your picking hand's glove cut off (kitchen shears will do this) to protect your hands as much as possible. When your container and stomach are full, transfer your harvest into one of your empty containers and resume picking.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Use these berries like commercial raspberries, raw or cooked, in virtually any dessert recipe. They're more flavorful that commercial raspberries, but more seedy. I add them to cereals, pancakes, muffins, sauces, pies, fruit salads, compotes, puddings, ice creams, jams, jellies, and drinks. If you purée them, strain out any hard seeds, which would otherwise be annoying.</field>

They provide vitamins A,  B1, B2, B6, C, E, K, pantothenic acid, and folate, as well as the minerals and trace minerals calcium, iron, magnesium, phosporus, potassium, sodium, zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raspberries are loaded with health-promoting antioxidants including ellagic acid, the flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol, and cyanidin-based molecules called cyanidin-3-glucosylrutinoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside. These phytochemicals are antimicrobial too, inhibiting pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;, which causes yeast infections and may aggravate irritable bowel syndrome. Research even indicates that eating raspberries reduces your chances of getting cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, buying enough raspberries to eat them regularly is quite expensive. Fortunately, wild raspberries are widespread and free, and they're easy to freeze.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">An infusion of the leaves and roots is used as an astringent for diarrhea, especially for children, since it's more gentle than other herbal astringents, but it's main use is as a tonic to the strengthen the female reproductive system. As such, it's been used for centuries by Native American, European, and Asian herbalists, and it contains constituents that both stimulate and relax the uterus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's used during the last three months of gestation, during childbirth, and to lessen the symptoms of menopause, as well as for menstrual cramps. It's also used for nausea and to suppress vomiting, as a gargle for tonsillitis and mouth inflammations, and as a poultice or wash for sores, conjunctivitis, minor wounds, burns, and varicose ulcers.</field>

      <field name="similarPlants">Botanists disagree over whether this American species is a subspecies of the Eurasian raspberry (&lt;i&gt;R. idaeus&lt;/i&gt;), which doesn't grow wild in North America, or whether they're separate species. I'd rather eat the berries than participate in the debate!</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Poison ivy and poison oak have palmate-compound leaves and often grow near or with raspberries, but the leaves aren't sharply toothed, there's no thorny cane, and the flowers and fruits are completely different. As long as you're on the lookout for these plants when you pick raspberries, you'll be able to avoid them.</field>

      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for small to medium-sized, gnarled trees with cracked (or smooth, if they're young), scaly, gray, brown or reddish-brown bark, and a dense, twiggy crown. The medium-sized, alternate leaves are coarse, elliptical, pointed, stalked, finely toothed, and medium- to dark green. The five-petaled, radially-symmetrical, fragrant, pink, red, or white flowers bloom in early spring. The spherical, green, yellow or red fruits vary in size.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">These small to medium-sized, gnarled trees, growing from 12 to 36 feet high, have cracked (smooth when young), scaly, gray, brown or reddish-brown bark, and a dense, twiggy crown. Some may have thorns, although I've never seen these. Botanists group apples into 30 to 55 species (it's hard to draw the line between species and subspecies, especially with the trees that hybridize readily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly fuzzy underneath, the coarse, elliptical, pointed, stalked, slightly toothed, medium- to dark green, alternate leaves grow from one to four inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White, pink, or red, the five-petaled, radially-symmetrical, fragrant, flowers, which grow up to 0.75 inches across, bloom in early spring and drop to the ground soon thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ripening in late summer or autumn, the red, yellow, or green fruit may look like an imperfect commercial apple or a smaller crab apple, but unlike other similar-looking fruit, the brown, teardrop-shaped apple grow in sets of 5 around core’s circumference. Split an apple in half along its “equator,” and they will always form a 5-parted star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Crab apples are defined as having fruit less than two inches across, apples as more than 2 inches across. Don't ask me what a tree is called if some of its fruit is less than two inches across, and some is larger!</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Bring strong bags and pick the windfall apples, those that have fallen by themselves, first. If they haven't been lying around long enough to rot, they're are the best ones. You can also shake the branches to increase your harvest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some trees bear bumpier and less perfect-looking than commercial apples, with bumps indicating healed injuries. Some apples contain insect larvae, mistakenly called “worms,” that leave brown, rotten trails inside the apple—quite distasteful, but not toxic. You can use slightly infested apples after you out cut out the bad parts. Some years are better for gathering an excellent wild apple crop, others are better for the "worms!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many, but not all, crab apple varieties are only good to eat when they get soft and orange-brown, in late fall. If they're hard and bitter and aren't falling to the ground yet, you're too early. The crab apples that taste good before they turn brown, on the other hand, usually ripen and start falling off the trees by mid-fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="cooking">Wild apples often differ from cultivated ones, more flavorful and tart, with rough or papery unwaxed skins. They’re compact rather than overly light and watery, and their flavors vary wonderfully from tree to tree. Commercial apples, which are bred for uniformity, durability, and appearance, not flavor. Wild apples are great raw, and far superior to commercial apples in pies, tarts, compotes, apple crisp, cobblers, applesauce, pancakes, stuffing, or any of the hundreds of dishes containing apples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s difficult to core the early-season crab apples that taste good before they turn brown and get soft. So long as they're ripe and not astringent, I cook them with fruit juice, spices, and a sweetener, then pass them through a food mill (you can also use a strainer) to remove the seeds, creating a very flavorful applesauce. You can also puree the cooked fruit, seeds and all, in a blender, if the seeds don't bother you. Crushed raw apple seeds are poisonous if eaten in quantity, but cooking destroys the toxin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soft, orange-brown, ripe fruit of late-season crab apples tastes like a sour tamarind, with the texture of applesauce. If you enjoy sour flavors, you’ll love eating them right off the tree. And if you cook them in apple juice, sweeten them, and remove the seeds with a food mill or strainer, you'll get an exotic apple-tamarind butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple blossoms are considered edible, although if you eat them in large quantities, you might have problems with the same poison that's in the seeds. However, though some disagree with me, I don't think they taste very good.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Apples provide vitamin A,  C, beta-carotene, and folate, plus the minerals calcium, phosphorus potassium, magnesium, and iron.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">The malic and tartaric acids that produce the fruit’s tartness supposedly assists digestion of rich foods, and the pectin apples contain helps to remove toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic, and copper from the body, although if you're suffering from acute heavy metal poisoning, you may need more fast-acting medical treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pectin is also a non-soluable fiber that prevents the intestinal damage and constipation associated with a low-fiber diet. It's also been shown to reduce blood cholesterol by binding with bile acids, thereby decreasing absorption of cholesterol and fat in the small intestine. If you're on cholesterol-lowering medication, eating lots of pectin-rich food may allow you to reduce your dosage of the drug, which does have its dangers. Of course, you'll have to have your cholesterol levels monitored to see how much of an effect you're getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, pectin slows absorption of sugars and carbohydrates in the intestine, increasing energy efficiency and slowing the rise of blood sugar. This benefits hypoglycemics and diabetics. Researchers at Yale’s Psychophysiology Center even found that the smell of spiced apples lowers blood pressure in people under stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, there are also myths about apples that are simply untrue. I'm sure you've heard the old saw that an apple a day keeps the doctor away. I once led a tour for medical doctors focusing on medicinal plants, but when we came upon a wild apple tree loaded with fruit, instead of turning away, the doctors all loaded their bags with the wild apples!</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Apple seeds contain amygdalin, which breaks down into cyanide. If you swallow a few seeds, the chemical won't be released in enough quantity to do any harm, and some people even think it's good for you, but if you crush the seeds and eat a bowlful, you could die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although cooking destroys this toxic compound, if it suddenly occurs to you that that you just happened to eat a whole bowlful of crushed, raw apple seeds, don't rush into the kitchen in a frenzy and start creating recipes—call 911, and Poison Control!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Hawthorn trees have edible fruit that looks like crab apples, but the branches have large thorns that look like knitting needles, and the seeds inside aren't arranged in five compartments, like the apple's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherry blossoms resemble white apple blossoms, and the trees bloom at the same time, but you can tell the difference right away by looking at the bark. Cherry bark is smooth, reddish-brown, and horizontally streaked with white, whereas apple bark is gray and scaly.</field>

      <field name="season">Autumn olives ripen mainly in mid-fall, although some bushes ripen earlier or later than average, in early or late fall. When I first started foraging in the early 1980s, the season was from early November to New Years in the Northeast. But due to climate change, the flowers begin blooming a month earlier, causing the fruit to ripen much earlier too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[-CORRECTION: As anyone who listens to talk radio knows, climate change is a myth perpetuated by all the climate scientists who get published in disreputable, peer-reviewed, international science journals, conspirators who know we're really heading into another ice age, but want to deceive everyone so they can get more funding (fortunately, they were smart enough to go into science to get rich, rather than such unlucrative professions as finance or corporate law). So the real explanation must be that Al Gore is sneaking out in the middle of the night to fool the autumn olive bushes (and all the other species that have so drastically shifted their life cycles—he's keeping himself quite busy) into flowering and fruiting early, so he can make more money selling his books!]</field>
      <field name="habitat">Sunny and partially shaded places with poor soil (like legumes, it can get nitrogen from the atmosphere), disturbed habitats, fields, thickets, parks, pastures, hay fields, roadsides, rights-of-way, and overgrown areas near the seashore</field>
      <field name="range">Autumn olives grow throughout most of Eastern North America and Ontario, plus Kansas, Nebraska, Washington, Oregon, and Montana, and there's no reason to doubt that this foreign invasive species won't keep spreading to other regions.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">East Asia</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">You can spot autumn olive bushes from quite a distance, even while driving  because of the distinctive silvery cast of the bush's leaves' undersides. Then look for a large shrub with gray bark, growing in dense stands, with lance-shaped to oval, dull green, dotted leaves that are silvery underneath.

      <field name="harvesting">Sample all the bushes you can before collecting. The largest, softest, juiciest berries are usually the best, while the small, hard, dry ones are the worst. Some people prefer more tart berries, others, especially kids, prefer the sweeter ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a key ring and clip to attach a food container with a hole punched near the top to your belt, to free both hands, and bring additional containers to transfer your harvest after you fill your collecting container. You can harvest very large quantities of this top-rate fruit under favorable circumstances.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The soft, ripe, juicy berries taste like a wonderful combination of pomegranates, plums, currants, cranberries, and raspberries, but better. Enjoy autumn olives raw, and spit out the seeds if desired (or eat the seeds too, if you want), or cook the fruit. I simmer it about ten minutes with a sweetener and a thickener to make jam, pie filling, or sauce, then strain out the seeds with a food mill. You can also make the purée without sweeteners or thickeners, and add those later, depending on what you're going to make. I use the it in cookies, cakes, ice cream, sherbet, and other desserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The berries freeze well both before and after cooking, and you can dehydrate the thickened, sweetened, strained pulp to make a fantastic fruit leather. I've [-also] made a delicious white wine out of autumn olive, and the Japanese also make a liqueur by soaking the berries in wine for six months. </field>
      <field name="nutrition">Autumn olives are high in vitamin A, C, E, and beta-carotene, plus essential fatty acids (very unusual for a fruit) and the antioxidants phytoene and cryptoxanthins. They have up to 17 times more of the anti-oxidant lycopene than tomatoes, making them useful in preventing or fighting prostate cancer, and possibly other malignancies.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">An infusion of the seeds is used as an expectorant for cough and pulmonary problems in traditional Chinese medicine.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Friendships and relationships have been destroyed by people arguing over which autumn olive bush has the best-tasting berries—stick to discussing less controversial subjects, such as politics, religion, and global warming! And while you're at it, watch out for the occasional thorns.</field>

      <field name="season">Blackberries are in season in the second half of the summer in the Northeast, but as early as June in the Deep South.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Full sun, partial shade, poor soil, thickets, clearings in the woods, along roadsides and paths, on hillsides and mountain slopes, in overgrown fields, disturbed habitats, ditches, hedgerows, empty lots, and bushy areas near the seashore.

      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Blackberries are also native to Eurasia and South America, so we have both native and foreign species growing throughout North America.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Here's a good way to collect lots of bramble berries with most effectively:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Plan your harvest in advance, choosing a relatively cool day, and forage early in the morning, so you can wear long pants and sleeves to protect yourself from thorns and mosquitoes without getting too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Punch a hole in the top of a food container, insert a key ring and attach it to your belt with a key clip, to free both hands for picking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Wear heavy-duty work gloves with the fingertips of your picking hand's glove cut off (kitchen shears will do this) to protect your hands as much as possible. (Be sure to remove the glove from your hand before cutting off the fingertips!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. When your container and stomach are full, transfer your harvest into one of your empty containers, and resume picking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blackberries keep ripening for nearly a month, so you can return for the unripe ones later. Some years are better for blackberries than others. If there's too much rain when the flowers are blooming, for example, pollinators can't do their job and the berries fail to form. Or if there are too many cloudy or rainy days when the berries are developing, they become stunted from lack of sunlight and don't get sweet. But in other years conditions are perfect, and there are more berries than even the very large groups that attend my tours can come close to picking!</field>
      <field name="cooking">Delicious raw or cooked, wild blackberries, which are much tastier than commercial blackberries, impart a powerful, earthy tang to complement their fruitiness. They're excellent in pies, puddings, cobblers, ice cream, cakes, cereals, smoothies, fruit sauces, jams, jellies, and virtually any dessert. And they're especially good in desserts that also include apples—a great companion fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike commercial blackberries, wild blackberries have hard seeds, which are very annoying in recipes that involve puréeing the fruit, but you can easily eliminate the seeds by passing the purée through a strainer or food mill.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Blackberries are rich in potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, phosphorous, beta-carotene, and vitamin C. They're also very high in healthful polyphenol antioxidants, i.e., ellagic acid, tannins, ellagitannins, quercetin, gallic acid, anthocyanins and cyanidins. These substances have been shown reduce the risk of contracting many common chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">DANGER! In Shakespeare's day, people called lawyers &lt;i&gt;bramble bushes&lt;/i&gt; because they have sharp thorns, grab on to you, and they don't let go until they've drawn blood! And that's still true today. So when you pick blackberries, be sure to protect yourself from the thorns, and from any lurking lawyers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don't eat blackberries after old Michaelmas Day, Oct. 11. According to English folklore, that's the day God ejected Satan from Heaven. He fell, kicking and screaming, and landed on a blackberry bush, which scratched him badly. In revenge, he peed on the blackberries, making them unfit for human consumption for the rest of the year!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">People confuse raspberries (&lt;i&gt;Rubus spp.&lt;/i&gt;), especially black raspberries, with blackberries, but raspberries have round stems, without blackberries' flat surfaces, and the fruit is hollow—the receptacle (the fruit's base) remains behind when you pick the fruit, unlike the blackberry, where the receptacle comes along for the ride, so blackberries are never hollow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mulberries (&lt;i&gt;Morus spp.&lt;/i&gt;) look a little like blackberries too, but these edible berries hang from the branches of trees on slender fruit stalks, unlike blackberries, which grow on a base on thorny canes.</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Poison ivy and poison oak have palmate-compound leaves and often grow near, or right with blackberries, but their leaves aren't sharply toothed, there's no thorny cane, and the flowers and fruits are completely different. As long as you're on the lookout for these plants when you pick blackberries, you'll easily be able to avoid brushing against them.</field>

They're also loaded with health-promoting antioxidants such as ellagic acid, the flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol, and the cyanidin-based molecules cyanidin-3-glucosylrutinoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research has linked the anthocyanins, which give black raspberries their color, with improved vision, cardiovascular health, memory retention in old age, and reduced risk of hypertension. Foods containing these substances have been demonstrated to lower the risk of contracting a wide variety of diseases, including cancer (eating a very large serving of black raspberries every day has already been proven to prevent esophageal cancer, but only if you're a rat), and they're antimicrobial too, inhibiting pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;, which causes yeast infections and may aggravate irritable bowel syndrome.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">As with wild red raspberries (&lt;i&gt;R. strigosus&lt;/i&gt;), an infusion of the leaves and roots is used as an astringent for diarrhea, especially for children, since it's more gentle than other herbal astringents, but it's main use is as a tonic to the strengthen the female reproductive system. As such, it's been used for centuries by Native American, European, and Asian herbalists, and it contains constituents that both stimulate and relax the uterus. It's used during the last 3 months of gestation, during childbirth, and to lessen the symptoms of menopause, as well as for menstrual cramps. It's also used for nausea and to suppress vomiting, as a gargle for tonsillitis and mouth inflammations, as a poultice for sores, and as a wash for conjunctivitis, minor wounds, burns, and varicose ulcers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black raspberries are finally being tested in humans to see if compounds they contain are effective in shrinking malignant esophageal and colon tumors.</field>

      <field name="similarPlants">A similar, closely related Western American species, &lt;i&gt;R. leucodermis&lt;/i&gt;, is also called black raspberry, and it's just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People confuse black raspberries with the related, edible blackberries (&lt;i&gt;Rubus spp&lt;/i&gt;), but blackberries aren't hollow, and their stems are angled, not ridged.</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Poison ivy (&lt;i&gt;Toxicodendron radicans&lt;/i&gt;) and poison oak (&lt;i&gt;T. diversilobum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;T. pubescens&lt;/i&gt;) have palmate-compound leaves and often grows near, or along with black raspberries, but the leaves aren't sharply toothed, there's no thorny cane, and the flowers and fruits are completely different. As long as you're on the lookout for these plants when you pick black raspberries, you'll be able to avoid them.</field>

Add them to cereal, put them in shakes, make jam or ice cream with them, mix them with other fruits to make a fruit salad, or bake them into muffins, pies, cobblers, or cakes.

This edible relative has berries that grow singly or in pairs, not in clusters, but like blueberries or huckleberries, and doesn't grow in the contiguous 48 states. Some other close relatives of blueberries and huckleberries (&lt;i&gt;Vaccinium spp.)&lt;/i&gt; with different features aren't palatable, but they won't poison you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue, edible berry of the juneberry (&lt;i&gt;Amelanchier spp.&lt;/i&gt;) also has a flared crown, but this unrelated shrub's bark is smooth and gray, the flower isn’t bell-shaped, it usually ripens toward the start of summer, and it contains relatively large, soft, almond-flavored seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black chokeberry (&lt;i&gt;Aronia melancarpa&lt;/i&gt;) bush, on the other hand, has berries you also might confuse with blueberries, but there's a five-parted star pattern that's impressed into the tip of the non-poisonous berry, not a flared crown, and the five-parted, radially symmetrical flowers are different from the blueberries' bell-like ones. Too astringent and awful-tasting to eat, there's nothing you can do with this aptly named fruit (often confused with the edible chokecherry, &lt;i&gt;Prunus virginiana&lt;/i&gt;, due to the similarity of their names) but to put it through a juicer and drink the juice, sweetened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The garden supply industry, trying to hawk black nightshade (&lt;i&gt;Solanum melanocerasum&lt;/i&gt;), a common weed with poisonous leaves, to gardeners, under a less sinister name, call it "garden huckleberry," sowing more confusion than sales. This non-woody relative of tomatoes has edible, spherical, black berries which, unlike blueberries lack a crown.</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">There are many spherical, blue berries, but no poisonous ones have a flared crown, so you'd have to be careless to the point of negligence to poison yourself with something like European buckthorn (&lt;i&gt;Rhamnus cathartica&lt;/i&gt;), which has no crown, and is different-looking from blueberries in all other respects too.</field>

Carnelian cherry grows mainly in cultivated areas, with scaly, gray-brown and yellow-tan, patchy bark. It has opposite, elliptical, untoothed, medium-sized leaves with pointed tips, wavy margins, and parallel veins on each side of the midrib. Clusters of tiny, bright yellow, four-sepaled flowers form in late winter or very early spring, and give way to juicy, olive-sized and -shaped, short-stalked, red or dark purple berries.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Collect the delicate ripe and nearly ripe fruit from the ground or from the branches (which you can shake over a dropcloth if the density of nearly ripe fruit is great enough), and place them in separate containers. You may store ripe fruit under refrigeration for a few days before using or freezing. [-And] [T]ransfer the unripe fruit to a shallow bowl, unrefrigerated until they ripen, which can take from a few days to nearly a week. You can hasten ripening by storing them with apples, which release ethylene gas to accomplish this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During periods of drought, you may [-also] find dehydrated ripe fruit on the branches which you can also collect and eat like raisins with pits, or soak in fruit juice (pear juice, which isn't acidic, works best for this sour fruit) to rehydrate, if desired. </field>
      <field name="cooking"> Unlike most other fruits, this one can ripen off the bush. Don't eat bright red berries. They're under-ripe, astringent, and way too sour. Wait until they turn dark purple and become very soft. They develop a delicious sour flavor, with overtones of cherries, lemons, cranberries, and plums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy ripe carnelian cherries raw, or cook them with a thickener and sweetener, strain out the seeds with a food mill, and use the tart, flavorful pulp to make jam, cake or cake topping, cookies, pies, ice cream, puddings, or any other kind of dessert. Only about 0.33 of your carnelian cherries will become pulp, but the sour flavor is so intense, you can mix the pulp with other ingredients and stretch your hard-earned wild harvest without dissipating the berries' taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, you can roast and grind the seeds and use them as a coffee substitute, but I've never tried this.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Carnelian cherries are an excellent source of vitamin C, potassium, calcium, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, and sodium. They also contain healthful antioxidant phenolic compounds, typical of brightly colored berries.</field>

The carnelian cherry’s fruit also superficially resembles a plum (&lt;i&gt;Prunus spp.&lt;/i&gt;), but plum trees, again, have alternate leaves and different flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The common spicebush's small, fragrant flowers look a little like the carnelian cherry's scentless ones, and they bloom at the same time, sometimes side-by-side but the spicebush, which has fragrant twigs, develops alternate, not opposite leaves. You can observe this in the leaf buds before the leaves develop. Before the leaves develop, the leaf buds are alternate, while all features on the carnelian cherry's twigs are opposite.

The berries are small, but if you can get the help of kids, who love collecting berries, you'll greatly speed up the process (unless they eat all the berries!)</field>
      <field name="cooking">This plant has a reputation of being poisonous and the leaves are dangerous, but over the years people around the world have been eating the &lt;i&gt;completely ripe&lt;/i&gt; berries without being harmed. My family and I (and hundreds of my tour participants) have been eating them too, and I consider them to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The berries taste like sweet tomatoes—quite delicious. However, they're quite small, so even when you find them in quantity, it takes a long time to collect enough for a recipe, so I use them mainly as a trail nibble or garnish, for which they're outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="nutrition"></field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">The unripe green berries are very poisonous, with high concentrations of the neurotoxin solanine. Eating them can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, followed by cardiovascular and central nervous system symptoms, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance (from the diarrhea), and cardiac arrhythmia. Circulatory and respiratory failure, possibly followed by death, although this is rare. There's no antidote, but with ER symptomatic supportive therapy, if you survive 24 hours, you should recover. Better yet, don't eat the green berries in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leaves contain the same poison, and even small amounts of an infusion of the leaves causes perspiration and purging of the bowels. Nevertheless, people in India, Africa, and East Asia eat the boiled leaves and discard the toxic water. Still, the boiled leaves contain enough poison that some individuals get very sick from eating the same meal that leaves others unaffected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew one such individual, who got her misadventure published in Science News Magazine. She ate some cooked black nightshade greens with Thai friends who were unharmed, but she got very, very sick for days. After she recovered, her friends told her that such severe reactions are not unfamiliar in their culture, and such individuals simply avoid this traditional vegetable (for some reason, a close brush with death tends to have that affect!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even if you don't develop symptoms, who knows what other harm this nerve toxin might be doing? So, this is one traditionally eaten wild green I strongly urge everyone to avoid. There are too many other tasty, healthful, safe wild greens to warrant the known and unknown risks of eating these leaves.</field>

      <field name="cooking">Beach plums are the best plums you’ll ever taste. The intense, sweet and tart flavor is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eat them raw, or remove the stones with a food mill or by hand. Cook with a thickener and sweetener either before or after pitting the fruit, and use the pulp in jams, jellies, drinks, pies, cakes, ice cream, sauces, cold cereal, oatmeal, puddings, smoothies, or any sweet recipes your imagination can conjure up.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Beach plums are a good source of vitamins A, C, and potassium, and they provide even more antioxidants than blueberries and cranberries, so eating them probably reduces your chances of getting heart disease, cancer, and other diseases.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses"></field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Beware of sand flies, which have a painful bite, and dense swarms of mosquitoes, if you collect in marshy habitats without a strong wind. Poison ivy also grows near or among beach plums, so learn this plant and carefully avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shrub is endangered in Maine, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, not because of foragers, but due to coastal development (habitat loss is a big danger to wild plants in general in the US, not foragers. If you live in those states, spit out plenty of pits when you eat the fruit, and fight the developers who like to build in ecologically sensitive sites where, due to the possibilities of hurricanes and flooding, aren't appropriate for human habitation in the first place!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Elsewhere, the American plum or wild plum (&lt;i&gt;P. americana&lt;/i&gt;) is the most common species, although there are other similar edible plums growing in various parts of the country too. The small, tart fruit is red or yellow, with only a little flesh—not quite as good as the beach plum, but still enjoyable. It grows in dense stands, like the beach plum, on moist soils in valleys, roadsides, low slopes and moist edges of forests and thickets of the Eastern part of the United States, ripening from late summer through fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Canada plum (&lt;i&gt;P. nigra&lt;/i&gt;) is a light reddish-orange, larger, tastier version of the American plum that also grows in the eastern states and Canada.</field>

      <field name="habitat">Black cherry trees are very common, growing in sunny and partially shaded habitats, cultivated parks, backyards, thickets, fields, and mixed hardwood forests, and along forest edges, residential streets, trail and field edges, and roadsides. I've found the best fruit growing in fields and thickets near the seashore.</field>
      <field name="range">Most of North America east of the Rocky Mountain states, and on mountains in the SW and Mexico</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin"></field>

      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a medium-sized tree with silver-gray, blocky bark punctuated with dark brown fissures and glossy, elliptical, finely toothed, sharp-pointed, thick, leathery, medium-sized, stalked, alternate, leaves.  Black cherry trees have showy terminal masses of oblong, cylindrical, drooping racemes with many small, rank-smelling, radially-symmetrical, white, five-petaled flowers and many spherical, short-stalked, shiny, black cherries which are reddish at first.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This medium-size tree can grow up to 125 feet tall, but 40 to 60 feet is usual, with a trunk up to 2.33 feet in diameter. Straight and narrow in forests, it develops a broad, irregular crown in open places. Whitish lenticels streaks its bark, which is shiny and silvery when young. When mature, it becomes blocky, cracking into upturned parts punctuated with dark brown, almost black fissures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scratch and sniff the reddish brown, white-dotted twigs, or crush the leaves, and you’ll detect the fragrance of &lt;i&gt;bitter almond&lt;/i&gt;, the same as inside the stones of related apricots or peaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glossy, elliptical, finely toothed, sharp-pointed, thick, leathery, stalked, alternate leaves, are lighter underneath, grow two to five inches long and one to 1.5 inches wide. They turn yellow, orange or red in the fall. Distinct, tiny, orange-brown hairs grow along the midrib of the leaf's underside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In early spring, after the leaves have developed, masses of oblong-cylindrical, green, drooping racemes four to six inches long and 0.75 to one inch in diameter grow at the ends of the current year's new growth. About 40 small, rank-smelling, radially-symmetrical, white, five-petaled flowers, less that 0.25 inch across, grow on each raceme, attracting pollinating flies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ripening on the same now-red racemes, many spherical, short-stalked, shiny black fruits, reddish at first, grow up to 0.5 inch in diameter. Each contains one hard stone 0.33 in diameter.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Black cherries vary greatly in quantity and quality from tree to tree and from year to year, with a really good crop every three or four years. Some trees usually produce sweet and juicy fruit, others small, hard, bitter cherries. Sample different trees and collect from one with the largest, softest, sweetest cherries, growing from trees with branches within reach, usually on larger trees growing in full sunlight. This tree is so common, you can afford to be choosy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it's a bad year, few trees will have fruit, and those that do usually have small, unpalatable cherries. If this is the case, try again the following year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punch a hole in the top of a food container, insert a key ring and attach it to your belt with a key clip, to free both hands for picking. When your container and stomach are full, transfer your harvest into one of your empty containers and resume picking.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="cooking">Black cherries are among the most unusual-tasting of wild fruits—with an intense bittersweet combination of commercial cherries, grapefruit, and wine— weird at first, then addictive, even though they're not very sweet. Enjoy them raw, as a snack, or cook them with a sweetener and thickener, strain out the seeds using a food mill, and turn them into jams, pie fillings, vegan cheesecake topping, sauces, puddings, and fruit leather. Fresh ginger, nutmeg, mint, and cloves are excellent companion seasonings, and the fruit's strong flavor holds its own with other strong flavors, so the purée is especially good in chocolate recipes.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Black cherries provide vitamin A, B1, C, folate, and pantothenic acid, plus calcium, magnesium, iron, sodium, phosphorus, potassium, copper, selenium, and zinc.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Eat just the cherries—the leaves contain high concentrations prunasin, harmless until you eat them. Then it turns to deadly cyanide, but not to worry— the decaying leaves are much more poisonous than the fresh ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seeds have the cyanide precursor too, but they're too hard too eat, and if you cook the cherries with the seeds, the heat destroys the toxin.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">There are other delicious wild cherry species that grow throughout the US:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People often confuse the black cherry tree with the similar chokecherry (&lt;i&gt;P. virginiana&lt;/i&gt;). However, chokecherry leaves’ midribs aren’t hairy beneath, and the smaller mature fruit's red, not black. And they're are so astringent, they’ll make your mouth pucker, unless you cook and sweeten them. This fruit grows in the same kind of habitats as the black cherry, but further north, especially in mountainous areas—throughout much of the northern half of the United States, much of California, and southern Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pin cherry (&lt;i&gt;P. pensylvanica&lt;/i&gt;), which grow high on the mountains, has shorter racemes, more narrow leaves, and long-stemmed red cherries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes black-colored commercial cherries are marketed under the name &lt;i&gt;black cherry&lt;/i&gt;, but they're really a dark cultivated version of the sweet cherry (&lt;i&gt;P. Avium&lt;/i&gt;). Both black and red varieties grow wild in Eastern and Western North America, but clusters of larger cherries hand from the twigs on long fruit stalks, not on the racemes of the native black cherry.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="season">These cherries ripen as spring gives way to summer.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Forests, edges of forests, edges of paths, park lands, cultivated areas</field>
      <field name="range">Eastern and Western North America, but not in Utah</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Eurasia and Northern Africa</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a small tree with purplish-brown bark, or a medium-sized tree with silvery gray cracked bark, both shiny streaked with horizontal white lines. The shiny, fine-toothed, medium-sized, oval, pointed, alternate leaves have distinct red glands on the leafstalks. Clusters of two to six radially-symmetrical, five-petaled, showy, long-stalked, white flowers grow on the twig tips. Small, smooth, spherical, red, yellow, or black umbrella-like clusters of long-stalked cherries replace the flowers when the weather begins to get hot.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Growing up from 50 to 70 feet tall, with the trunk dominant over the branches, the sweet cherry tree is a feral form of the commercial cherry, created from seed, not from cuttings, so that it's more like ancestral wild cherries than the uniform cultivated clones of orchard and backyards. The symmetrical, conical crown becomes rounded to irregular with age. White, horizontal lines streak the shiny, smooth, purplish-brown bark, which becomes dark silvery gray and fissured with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shiny, fine-toothed, oval, pointed, alternate leaves, which turn orange, pink, or red in the fall, grow from 2.75 to over 5.5 inches long and 1.5 to 2.75 inches wide. The reddish leafstalk, which has two to five small, red glands (nectaries, where insects that protect the tree from herbivores get fed), grows from under an inch to 1.33 inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In early spring, clusters of two to six radially-symmetrical, five-petaled, showy white flowers, each one inch to 1.5 inch across, bloom on the tips of the twigs on flower stalks one to two inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small, smooth, spherical, red, yellow, or black, long-stalked cherries, 0.5 to one inch across and containing one hard seed 0.33 inches across, ripen close to the start of summer. The stalks of several cherries originate from the same point on the twig.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Smooth, shiny bark, purplish-brown on young trees, becoming dark silvery gray and cracked with age&lt;br /&gt;•Bark streaked with horizontal white lines&lt;br /&gt;•Shiny, fine-toothed, oval, pointed, alternate leaves 2.75 to over 5.5 inches long and 1.5 to 2.75 inches wide&lt;br /&gt;•Clusters of two to six radially-symmetrical, showy, long-stalked, 5-petaled white flowers, one inch to 1.5 inch across, growing on twig tips&lt;br /&gt;•Small, smooth, spherical red, yellow, or black, long-stalked cherries 0.5 to one inch across&lt;br /&gt;•Stalks of several cherries originating from the same point on the twig&lt;br /&gt;•One hard seed 0.33 inches across inside each cherry</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Sweet cherries are often hard to collect because too often, few branches grow within reach. And when a friend who repairs roofs for a living ascended one of these with me, using his mega-ladder, we still had to &lt;i&gt;go out on a limb&lt;/i&gt; to reach the fruit. So look for young, relatively small trees at the edges of woodlands and in cultivated parks. You might get a really good crop from these every three to four years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To collect efficiently, punch a hole in the top of a food container, insert a key ring, and attach it to your belt with a key clip, to free both hands for picking. When your container and stomach are full, transfer your harvest into one of your empty containers and resume picking.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="cooking">Sweet cherries are smaller and more tart than commercial cherries, with a more intense cherry flavor. Use them raw or cooked like commercial cherries, in sweetened puddings, cakes, cereals, salads, smoothies, pies, ice cream, jams, and other desserts. To remove the seeds cook them with a sweetener and thickener and strain out the seeds using a food mill, or use a cherry pitter or paring knife. </field>
      <field name="nutrition">In addition to carbohydrates, cherries provide vitamins C and K, folate; the carotinoids beta-carotene,  choline, zeanxanthin, and lutein; and the minerals calcium, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">A decoction of the fruit stalks is considered astringent, diuretic and tonic, and has been used to treat cystitis, edema, bronchitis, diarrhea, and anemia. However it contains amygdalin and prunasin, potential sources of cyanide. Small amounts of these substances stimulate respiration, improve digestion, and create a feeling of well-being, but only if they don't release cyanide and kill you first (stick to safer medicinal plants)!</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Except for the ripe fruit, all parts of the tree contain the toxic cyanogenic glycoside, amygdalin, which may break down into cyanide and cause gasping, weakness, excitement, pupil dilation, spasms, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and death, although if you cook the cherries before straining out the pits, the heat will destroy the toxins in the pits.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Black birch bark looks similar to cherry bark, but it's never reddish and has fewer cracks. All the trees' other features differ, and even in the winter, injured cherry twigs smell like bitter almond, whereas black birch trees smell like wintergreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some apple and crab apple trees with white blossoms bloom at the time as sweet cherries, but apple bark is gray and scaly, not smooth, shiny, or streaked with horizontal white lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes sweet cherries get blackish, but they're not the same as our native black cherry, which has flowers and fruit ripening later in the season, and growing along long racemes. Nevertheless, like sweet cherries, black cherries are also sometimes confusingly called wild cherries.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="range">This shrub grows mainly in the southern Appalachians, but you may also find it in New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, parts of the Midwest, and Canada. Distribution is spotty because it was eradicated in many areas in the past, in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the spread of wheat rust.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin"></field>

      <field name="harvesting">Punch a hole in the top of a food container, insert a key ring and attach it to your belt with a key clip, to free both hands for picking. Bring additional food containers to transfer your harvest when your collection container gets full. Wear heavy-duty work gloves with the fingertips cut off your picking hand, for protection against the thorns. Long sleeves and long pants are very helpful, as is planning foraging early on a relatively cool morning.</field>
      <field name="cooking"> American barberries are very tart, so they're good used to perk up dishes with less acidic fruits, such as peaches or mangoes. You can use the fresh berries, or dehydrated and reconstituted ones, in pies, tarts, jams, jellies, and as a sour flavoring ingredient in desserts. For cooked recipes, remove the seeds with a food mill after cooking the berries with some fruit juice. You may also add a sweetener and thickener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may also pickle the berries, or purée the cooked berries in fruit juice and a sweetener to make a traditional drink, again, with the seeds removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sour-flavored, tender, young leaves are edible as well. Add them to salads or sandwiches, use them as garnishes, or add them to cooked vegetable dishes. They cook in about 10 minutes.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Barberries are a good source of vitamin C.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">A decoction of the cambium or the roots contains berberine, which has antibiotic and anti-cancer effects, but isn't absorbed through the digestive system, so it's used for bacterial infections of the digestive tract, especially dysentery. Berberine also has demonstrated anti-tumor activity, which should be followed up with additional research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decoction has also been used for fevers, indigestion, diarrhea, arthritis, jaundice and liver disorders, and various acute inflammations, as well as for vaginal yeast infections. Native Americans chewed the rhizomes for painful canker sores.</field>

      <field name="similarPlants">The common barberry &lt;i&gt;(B. vulgaris)&lt;/i&gt; is so similar to the American species that botanists used to classify the American shrub as a subspecies of this European one. The common barberry has gray instead of reddish brown bark, and its leaves have 16 to 30 teeth instead of two to 12. Its uses, habitats, and range are similar to its American relative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Japanese barberry &lt;i&gt;(B. thunbergii)&lt;/i&gt;,with unpalatable berries and edible young leaves, grows across much of Northern North America and parts of the Southwest, but not in the Deep South. Its leaves lack teeth, and the thorns have one part, not three, like the American species.</field>

      <field name="season">Common strawberries ripen at the end of spring or start of summer, and you can use the leaves for tea from spring to fall.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Open, sunny places, partial shade, moist ground, dry openings, open woods, woodland edges, rocky areas, in meadows and fields, near the seashore, and on hillsides and slopes</field>
      <field name="range">This widespread fruit, which is divided into 4 very similar subspecies, grows throughout all of North America.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin"></field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a trailing, colonial plant with a three-parted palmate-compound leaf atop a long leafstalk with coarsely-toothed, oval, leaflets. Common Strawberry has open terminal clusters of five-petaled, radially-symmetrical, white flowers blooming on a leafless stem and tiny, oval strawberries.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This trailing, weakly to strongly hairy, colonial plant grows from two to six inches tall, arising from slender, horizontal, reddish-tinged runners up to two feet long, and short, scaly rhizomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The palmate-compound leaf grow atop a long, finely hairy leafstalk about six inches long. Pale green underneath, the three oval to wedge-shaped leaflets, one to three inches long and about 1.5 inches wide, have coarse, sharp, even teeth and very short leafstalks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In mid-spring, a softly hairy, leafless stem three to four inches long arises from the ground with open, terminal clusters of two to 15 five-petaled, radially-symmetrical, odorless white flowers, each 0.5 to one inch across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The familiar red berries, white at first, ripen about five weeks later. 0.5 to 0.75 inch across, they look like tiny, oval versions of commercial strawberries, with tiny seeds partially sunken into the flesh, and ten tiny, green sepals at the fruit’s base.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">These very tasty berries are so small, they take a long time to collect, especially if you can't resist eating each one you pick, or if you expect them to fill your stomach. Bring one small food container, an electronic listening device, and an audiobook version of War and Peace before you settle in!</field>
      <field name="cooking">Although wild strawberries have way more flavor than commercial strawberries, they're very small. They're great used in cold  and hot cereals, pancakes, fruit salad, ice cream, sauces, jam, or other desserts, like commercial strawberries, although they're so tedious to collect they usually become a minor, albeit very tasty, component of dishes.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Strawberries provide magnesium, potassium, beta-carotene, iron, and malic and citric acids, and an infusion of the leaves provides vitamin C and K. </field>

      <field name="similarPlants">The woodland strawberry (&lt;i&gt;F. vesca&lt;/i&gt;) is very similar to the common strawberry and very tasty, but with a larger, elongated, pointed fruit, rather than an oval one. It grows throughout North America except Nebraska, Oklahoma, Nevada, and the Southeast. For foragers, the two species are interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The commercial strawberry is a hybrid of the common strawberry and the beach strawberry (&lt;i&gt;F. chiloensis&lt;/i&gt;), a flavorless Chilean species that grows on the West Coast. The commercial strawberry rarely escapes into the wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of the dreaded Indian strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Duchesnea indica&lt;/i&gt;). Usually growing on the edges of trails, in moist woods, and in cultivated parks. This Asian species, which grows in Eastern North America and the West Coast, but not in New England, has a luscious-looking round strawberry with seeds that stand out from the surface, not indented like the common strawberries. It has backwards-pointing sepals, and yellow flowers instead of white ones. Disaster invariably strikes when any unwary forager samples this tempting-looking fruit: It has no flavor whatsoever—the berry is as tasteless as my jokes—and moments after ingestion, the hapless victim dies of disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Common cinquefoil (&lt;i&gt;Potentilla simplex&lt;/i&gt;) is another very dangerous plant with leaves that resemble strawberry leaves enough to fool people, even though it has five leaflets rather than three, and the flowers are also yellow instead of white. People have waited, transfixed, for this non-poisonous plant to produce a strawberry that never appears, until they finally succumb to old age! </field>

      <field name="habitat">Cranberries generally grow in acidic bogs and wet areas with poor soil, including bogs behind sand dunes near the seashore, in pine barrens, and in glaciated regions. The small and large cranberries grow in bogs, peaty soil and swamps, while the mountain cranberry grows in cool, moist, acidic woodlands and rocky, mountainous habitats.</field>

One to Four inches tall, it rarely grows over one foot long. The pointed, oval leaves, 0.25 to 0.375 inch long, have distinctive edges that are rolled under, and its stems are thinner than other species'. The drooping, pink to red flowers, 0.375 across, and the fruit, 0.5 inch across, grow in small terminal clusters or singly, but not from the leaf axils.

Its leaves are larger than other species, 0.4 to 0.8 inches long. The pale pink to white flowers, which grow to about 0.5 inch long, and the fruit, grow from the leaf axils, not in terminal clusters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mountain cranberry (&lt;i&gt;V. vitis-idaea&lt;/i&gt;) grows two to 16 inches tall, usually standing upright instead of creeping. The oval, oblong, or elliptical leaves turn purplish in autumn. The white to pink flowers, only 0.25 inch across, grow in terminal racemes of one to 15, and the berries, 0.2 to 0.4 inch across, ripen in late summer and early fall.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Wear warm, waterproof clothing and waterproof shoes if possible, sit on the ground on a mat or squat, pick the berries with your fingers, and transfer them to food containers.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Use the fruit like you'd use commercial cranberries—because they've only been brought into cultivation in recent centuries, the wild and commercial varieties don't differ greatly. Like apples, they contain pectin, a natural thickener. And because they’re cold-adapted, they store well in a freezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cranberries are too bitter, acidic and mealy for anyone but the most dedicated raw food proponents to enjoy without cooking. Of course, cooking them with a sweetener and making cranberry sauce is the most common way to use them. But I also add them to pie filling, fruit crisps, cobblers, and other desserts. They're great cooked and added them to ice cream, where their tart flavor effectively offsets the other ingredients' creamy sweetness. I've found that apples and walnuts are especially good companion ingredients. </field>
      <field name="nutrition">Cranberries provide vitamins A and C, beta-carotene, calcium, lutein, zeaxanthin, magnesium, manganese, potassium, and phosphorus, and they're also an excellent source of healthful antioxidants called anthocyanins which may benefit the cardiovascular and immune systems, and inhibit cancer.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Cranberries contain quinic, malic, citric and hippuric acids. A substantial body of research shows that drinking cranberry juice fights urinary tract infections by preventing pathogenic bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; from sticking to the mucus membranes, and there's also evidence of direct anti-bacterial activity too. The juice is used to treat and prevent urinary tract infections, kidney disorders, incontinence, and cystitis, and the juice is a gentle, effective diuretic too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eating cranberries has been observed to aid the digestion of fat and protein, which is why cranberries often accompany rich meals. They're also used to reduce fever and soothe skin inflammations, although these claims remain to be tested.</field>

      <field name="cooking">Wild currants are very tasty but intensely sour, nothing like the unrelated commercial currants, which are really unrelated mini-raisins. Although wild currants are edible raw, like cranberries, they're much better sweetened and cooked. The seeds are so soft and tiny, you don't have to remove them. Furthermore, currants contain pectin, so they don't need much thickener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Europe people use currants for making juices, wines, jams, and tarts, and Native Americans cooked them with corn. I find them great in sweet, creamy desserts, such as puddings and pies, or in sauces, where their flavor can contrast those of the other ingredients. They go especially well with sweeter fruits, like apples, pears, bananas, and mangoes, and you can even bake them into breads. The same kinds of recipes that work with cranberries work with currants, although you can also use them in place of lemon or lime juice in any recipe that needs a sour touch.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Currants are a good source of vitamins A and C, and the minerals potassium, phosphorous, and calcium. They also contain malic and citric acid, as well as pectin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seeds of the black currant (&lt;i&gt;R. nigrum&lt;/i&gt;) also provide gamma-linolenic acid, good for lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease.</field>

      <field name="similarPlants">Commercial currants (&lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt;), also called Zante currants, aren't currants at all, but a dried species of grape, which is why they're so similar to commercial raisins, and so different from wild currants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gooseberries (&lt;i&gt;Ribes spp.&lt;/i&gt;) are similar close relatives of currants, with thorny stems and bristly fruit. Except for bristly currants (&lt;i&gt;R. lacustre&lt;/i&gt;), currants are thornless. And gooseberries have 3 flowers (followed by 3 berries) originating from the leaf axils, not the dangling racemes of currants. Gooseberries are widespread too, and you use them like currants after you remove the bristles, easier to do after cooking. I wish they grew in my area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maple-leaf viburnum (&lt;i&gt;Viburnum acerifolium&lt;/i&gt;) is a shrub with leaves similar to currants, but they're opposite, not alternate, and the inedible fruit, which contains one seed, looks different and grows in an umbrella-like cluster.</field>

      <field name="plantType"/>
      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">Elderberry flowers bloom in late spring and go out of season at the start of summer, while the berries reach their peak during the second half of the summer, and are usually gone in early fall.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Sunny and partially shaded, moist and dry places, in marshes, along riverbanks and roadsides, and in open woods and thickets</field>
      <field name="range">Eastern North America</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin"></field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for dense stands of large shrubs with gray, corky bark and dark green, large, opposite, feather-compound leaves with short-stalked, sharply pointed, saw-toothed, elliptical, medium-sized leaflets. Common Elderberry's showy, branched, lacy panicles have six to 12 of many tiny, white, five-petaled, star-shaped flowers. Those same panicles will produce tiny, shiny, spherical, juicy, purple-black to black, oblong berries.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This large shrub, which usually grows in dense stands, reaches from five to 15 feet tall and becomes equally wide. With many slender, arching branches and a broad, rounded crown, corky bumps (lenticels) spot the smooth, gray bark. A white, spongy pith grows inside the twigs and branches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opposite, feather-compound, dark green leaves, which turn yellow, orange, and red in autumn, may grow over three feet long. They smell unpleasant when cut or bruised. Divided into five to 11 opposite, saw-toothed, sharply pointed, short-stalked, elliptical leaflets, each two to seven inches long and half as wide. The leading leaflet's the longest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reaching six to 12 inches across, slightly rounded to flat-topped, showy, lacy panicles of many tiny, branched, white, five-petaled, star-shaped, sweet and musty smelling flowers bloom in late spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From mid-summer to early fall, the same panicles weigh down the branches when they're loaded with many tiny, shiny, spherical, juicy, purple-black to black berries, each 0.125 to 0.25 inch across, with three to five tiny, hard seeds inside.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Large shrub in dense stands with gray, corky bark&lt;br /&gt;•White pith inside the twigs and branches&lt;br /&gt;•Dark green, opposite, feather-compound leaves over three feet long, divided into five to 11 opposite leaflets&lt;br /&gt;•Short-stalked, sharply pointed, saw-toothed, opposite, elliptical leaflets two to seven inches long&lt;br /&gt;•Slightly rounded to flat-topped, lacy, branched panicles, six to 12 inches across, of tiny, five-petaled, star-shaped, white flowers, blooming in late spring&lt;br /&gt;•Panicles of tiny, shiny, spherical, juicy, purple-black to black berries, each with three to five tiny, hard seeds inside, ripening from mid-summer to fall</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Break off the flower or berry clusters where they're relatively abundant—much easier than collecting most other berries. Avoid bushes with bad-tasting, rank-smelling, yellowing, overripe flowers, those with many unripe berries, or those where many of the berries have already fallen off. Bushes that get the most sunlight are usually the best.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Separate the flowers or berries from the stems, in the field or at home, using your fingers—labor-intensive but worth it. Freezing the berries on a tray or cookie sheet beforehand speeds the process. Discard any stems, which are mildly poisonous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flowers' delicate flavor is a little like vanilla. Not edible raw, they're great in fritters, provided you don't overpower them with stronger-tasting flavors. You can make a tasty infusion with elder flowers plus mint, or a fragrant, potent wine (you can also make wine with the berries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also stuff a jar full of elder flowers, cover it with white vinegar, refrigerate it, shake it twice a day for two weeks, and strain out the flowers. The vinegar will take on the flowers' flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strongly flavored, crunchy, berries are excellent in any dish where you'd cook fruit—pancakes, ice cream, or puddings, for example. Unlike most other berries, they're not sweet or acidic, so add a sweetener (and thickener, if applicable). Depending on the recipe, something sour like lemon juice or sumac concentrate is helpful too. Elderberries also go well in desserts that include sweeter fruits. They're superb in baked dishes such as muffins, breads, and cakes. Use them, sweetened, like raisins.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="nutrition">The berries are an excellent source of potassium and beta-carotene, as well as sugar and fruit acids, plus calcium, phosphorous, and vitamin C.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">The elderberry was used medicinally by Native Americans, and Hippocrates used a European species in 400 BC. Use only the flowers and berries for home remedies. Other parts of the plants, which have been used in traditional herbal medicine, are dangerous, with compounds that can easily turn into cyanide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distilled elderflower water is used to clean the skin, lighten freckles, and treat sunburn. An infusion or tincture of the flowers is supposed to be astringent, expectorant and diaphoretic. It's used with yarrow and peppermint for colds, flu, and asthma, and there's research indicating that it helps the immune system combat flu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbalists also use elder flower infusion to soothe children's upset stomachs, and to relieve gas, and it's applied externally to swellings, rashes, and chilblains. It's used as an eyewash for conjunctivitis and eye inflammations. People also steeped the flowers in oil to make a massage lotion, which they also applied to burns and rashes, although dressing a burn with oil may make things worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An infusion of the berries is also considered astringent and diaphoretic. It's been used for colds, excessive mucus, and sore throats.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">Only the cooked flowers and ripe berries of the elderberry are edible. Avoid eating other parts, which contain enough of a toxic alkaloid and cyanogenic (cyanide-releasing) glycosides to cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and coma. On the plus side, they don't contain enough poison to cause death!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't eat raw elderberries. They don't taste good to most people, and they're more likely to cause adverse reactions, but cooking or dehydration removes the rank flavor, and any slight residues of toxins. Eat only a small number of berries the first time, and increase your portions gradually. Elderberries make produce nausea and vomiting in 1 out of 50 people. </field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Other elderberry species (&lt;i&gt;Sambucus spp.&lt;/i&gt;) grow throughout North America. The blue elder (&lt;i&gt;S. cerulea&lt;/i&gt;) is a West Coast species similar to the common elderberry, but with dark blue to blackish berries. Reportedly even better-tasting than the common elderberry, as a New Yorker, I've never had the opportunity to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor have I had the opportunity to try those species with red berries, which also grow in the Western US. All the better, since, while they're nonpoisonous, they're supposed to taste terrible.</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Water hemlock is a deadly plant with umbrella-like clusters of white flowers and feather-compound leaves, but, unlike the common elderberry, it's herbaceous, not woody. Also, water hemlock's long-stemmed, umbrella-like flower clusters themselves are clustered like umbrellas (compound umbels), and its leaves are twice- or 3 times compound, not once-compound like the elder's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devil's walkingstick is a shrub or small tree with alternate feather-compound leaves that looks only a little like the common elderberry bush. It has edible shoots, but flat clusters of poisonous, black berries arranged small rings, and a short, unbranched, thorny trunk. Elderberry bushes have branches, large clusters of berries, no thorns, and opposite, not alternate, feather-compound leaves.</field>

      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">Most wild grape species are in season in autumn, although I once found ripe grapes in late summer. The leaves and tendrils are at their best from mid-to late spring, although you can still collect some in early summer.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Wild grapes grow in sunny and partially shaded habitats, in open woodlands and park lands, along lightly wooded trails, in edge habitats, thickets, and fields, on trees and fences, along streams and riverbanks, in thickets inland and near the seashore, and in wetlands. </field>
      <field name="range">Throughout North America</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Various grape species are native to North America, but we also have Eurasia species, plus hybrids.</field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for high-climbing or creeping vines, usually forming dense thickets, with brown bark shredding in vertical strips. The persistent forked tendrils grow opposite to the three- or five-lobed, pointed, toothed, maple-like alternate leaves. Long clusters of about 20 dark purple, slightly greenish, or reddish, thick-skinned, spherical fruits, similar to commercial grapes, ripen mainly in autumn.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">These high-climbing woody vines, which can also grow along the ground or create thickets, my reach from 60 to 100 feet in height. Brown bark shreds off in vertical strips, making wild grapes easily recognizable any time of year. Persistent forked tendrils attach the vine to trees and fences. They grow opposite to the leaves and become dark and brittle over time,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually three- or five-lobed, the broadly triangular to nearly heart-shaped or oval, pointed, toothed, alternate leaves, two to eight inches long and equally wide, resemble maple leaves. Veins spread like fingers from the leaf's base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long, inconspicuous clusters of tiny, fragrant, five-petaled, yellow-green flowers bloom in the leaf axils in mid-spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green when immature, ripe wild grapes grow from 0.5 to 0.75 inch across. Spherical, smooth-skinned, and usually dark purple, they're occasionally slightly greenish or reddish. They grow in long clusters of about 20, like commercial grapes, but with thicker skins. Each grape contains two to six small, hard seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild grapes most closely resemble commercial Concord grapes, and one wild species, the fox grape (&lt;i&gt;V. labrusca&lt;/i&gt;), with the largest, sweetest, and tastiest fruit, is actually the Concord’s ancestor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 50 native  species, plus introduced varieties and hybrids, grow throughout North America, and they're very hard to tell apart, but that's not a big concern for foragers, as they're all good to eat raw or cook.</field>
      <field name="positiveId">•High-climbing or creeping vine with brown bark shredding in vertical strips&lt;br /&gt;•Persistent forked tendrils opposite to the leaves, becoming dark and brittle over time&lt;br /&gt;•Three- or five-lobed, broadly triangular, nearly heart-shaped or oval, pointed, toothed, alternate leaves, two to eight inches long and equally wide&lt;br /&gt;•Long, inconspicuous clusters of tiny, fragrant, yellow-green, five-petaled flowers, blooming in the leaf axils in mid-spring&lt;br /&gt;•Long clusters of about 20 dark thick-skinned, spherical, purple, slightly greenish, or reddish fruits 0.5 to 0.75 inch across, similar to commercial grapes&lt;br /&gt;•Two to six small, hard seeds inside each grape</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Collect medium-sized grape leaves. The smaller ones won't hold much stuffing and fall apart too easily, while the largest ones are too coarse and tough. You can also gather the green tendrils until they become too tough to chew, in mid-summer. Kids love hunting for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You usually have to search for fruit-bearing vines, since most grape vines don't bear fruit most years, and some years are better than others. Grapes do best in sunny locations and in dry years. Strip ripe grapes off the vines with your hands, and transfer them to food containers, or break off whole clusters and remove the grapes at home.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Grape leaves, a traditional food in the Middle East, where they're stuffed, are quite delicious. Cut off the stems and boil fresh grape leaves in lightly salted 1 minute (a dash of vinegar or olive oil is optional), turn off the heat, and let them steep in the hot water, covered, for 5 minutes or until tender, but not fragile. Then plunge them into cold water to stop the cooking. They should be tender enough to eat, but not so soft that they fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To stuff grape leaves, use any kind of stuffing that appeals to you, place a dollop in the center of the underside of a leaf, fold over the left and right edges so they meet in the center, and roll up the leaf from bottom to top. You may also cook chopped grape leaves in soups and stews, added at the end of the cooking time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grape tendrils are also good. They're too small to use as a major ingredient, but with their outstanding sour flavor, they make an excellent trail nibble and garnish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild grapes have more flavor than commercial grapes, but they're less sweet, the skin is tougher, and they always have seeds. The ones that are too sour to enjoy raw are still great cooked, because of the intense flavor they add to any dessert. Cook them with a sweetener, plus a thickener if appropriate, and remove the seeds using a food mill. The pulp makes great jams, fruit sauces, toppings, puddings, ice cream, pancakes, and pie fillings. And, of course, you can also use wild grapes to make wine.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Grapes provide potassium, beta-carotene, fructose, tartaric acid, flavonols, caffeic acid, ellagic acid, quercetin, tannin, and malic acid, and the leaves are an excellent source of beta-carotene and vitamin B3.</field>

      <field name="similarPlants"></field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">People have confused three poisonous plants with wild grapes, but there are distinct differences you can use to tell them apart, so you won't poison yourself if you're careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canada moonseed (&lt;i&gt;Memispermum canadense&lt;/i&gt;) is a rare vine with leaves and fruit that resemble those of grapes. Fortunately, there are three distinct differences that make them easy to tell apart:&lt;br /&gt;1. Each grape has many seeds, while Canada moonseed has one flattened seed shaped like a crescent moon.&lt;br /&gt;2. Canada moonseed lacks the tendrils all grapes have, and climbs by twining.&lt;br /&gt;3. Canada moonseed’s leafstalk attaches to the leaf by poking through the leaf near the base, while the grape’s leafstalk attaches at the leaf base. All parts of Canada moonseed contains a bitter toxic alkaloid called dauricine, that can lead to convulsions and death. There's only one good thing you can do with Canada moonseed: send it back to Canada!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Virginia creeper (&lt;i&gt;Parthenocissus quinquefolia&lt;/i&gt;) is a common, low-growing or high-climbing poisonous vine with a palmate-compound leaf consisting of five toothed, elliptical leaflets, each up to about six inches long—completely different from the grape's simple, lobed leaves. Nevertheless, people have confused the tiny, spherical, blue-black berries, which contain oxalic acid, with grapes. Eating any part of this plant causes nausea, abdominal pain, bloody vomiting and diarrhea, dilated pupils, headache, sweating, weak pulse, drowsiness, twitching of face, and sometimes death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Porcelainberry or amur peppervine (&lt;i&gt;Ampelopsis brevipedunculata&lt;/i&gt;) is the best of the three look-alikes to use if you're going to accidentally poison yourself. All it will give you is a stomachache! This high-climbing vine has leaves similar to grape leaves, and tendrils too, but the vine isn't woody, it has a white pith rather than the brown pith of grape vines, and the gaudy, ripe fruit can be blue, purple, turquoise, or white—quite different from grapes.</field>

Place 1 tbs. of the stuffing in the center of the back of a leaf, fold over the left and right sides so they meet in the center, over the stuffing, and roll up the leaf from the base to the tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.

The husk becomes tan and papery as the fruit ripens, and the fruit becomes soft and sweet-tasting. To test for ripeness, feel whether the fruit is soft. In some species, the ripening berry will even burst through the husk.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Ground cherries taste like sweet tomatoes, so you can use them like fruits or like vegetables.

      <field name="harvesting">Some hawthorn trees have tiny fruits that consist of more seed than pulp. These are only good for making tea, or as a trail nibble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have fruits close to an inch across. These are the best. Make sure they’re ripe—completely red, with no trace of green, and a little soft. Open a few to make sure they're not infested with maggots, which happens consistently on some individual trees, and rarely if ever on others. (This is especially important if you're a vegetarian.) Then pack the fruit that you don't eat into food containers.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Hawthorn fruits taste a little like sour apples, and they also contain pectin, the same thickener you get in apples. Eat them raw, or cook them in apple- or other fruit juice with a sweetener, along with sweet herbs such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger or allspice. Then strain out the seeds with a food mill and blend in the blender or food processor if desired, to make a something akin to applesauce. Otherwise, cut out the seeds with a paring knife and use the fruit in any recipe that calls for apples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The developing leaves, albeit somewhat bland-tasting, are good in soups, stews, and chili, cooked about 10 minutes.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Hawthorn berries provide vitamins C, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, and B12, plus PABA, choline, inositol, as well as flavonoids.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">When harvesting hawthorns, don't poke yourself with the thorns, and don't forage from those trees where the berries are infested with maggots.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Crabapples, also edible, look like hawthorns, but hawthorns have no core: if you cut an apple across the "equator", the seeds form a five-parted star pattern, which you won't find inside hawthorns.</field>

      <field name="season">The fruit of most juneberry species ripen in late spring, and you can sometimes still pick a few of their berries in summer. Some species ripen in the summer and fall, but they're relatively rare.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Various species prefer different habitats, although they generally grow in full sunlight or partial shade. You can find juneberries in moist and somewhat dry soil, in woods, along streams and lakes, on mountains, in thickets, clearings, and cultivated parks, in fields near the ocean, and on the grounds of landscaped parks, garden apartment complexes, and shopping malls, where they're planted for their showy flowers.</field>
      <field name="range">Juneberries grow throughout most of the US and Canada. </field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Most juneberries are native, but a couple of Eurasian species are sometimes planted too.</field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for multi-stemmed bushes or small trees with tight, smooth, ash gray to dark gray bark, marked with darker vertical lines and oval to elliptical, finely-toothed, stalked, medium-sized, alternate leaves that are light green underneath. The long, sparse racemes usually bear four to 20 showy, five-petaled, radially-symmetrical, medium-sized white flowers with five sepals. Later on, look for loose clusters of spherical blue berries, reddish or purple when unripe, each tipped with a 5-parted crown.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This group of mostly native multi-stemmed shrubs or small trees hybridize among themselves, making it hard to determine the number of species (botanists claim from six to 33 species), much less distinguish between them. But they all have smooth to slightly furrowed, tight, ash-gray to blackish bark, marked with wavy, vertical, dark gray to reddish stripes. Some species can grow up to 60 feet tall, but most are closer to 20 feet, with a spread of about ten feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oval to elliptical, finely-toothed, stalked, alternate leaves, which turn red, yellow, or orange in the fall, usually grow to about two inches long and one inch wide, often with slightly downy, light green undersides. The leaf tip is pointed, the base rounded to slightly heart-shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long, sparse racemes two inches long, with four to 20 five-petaled, radially symmetrical, five-petaled white flowers, each 0.75 inch across and with five sepals, bloom early in the spring, before the leaves develop fully. With many conspicuously protruding stamens, they resemble the blossoms of their relative, the apple tree (&lt;i&gt;Malus spp.&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ripe blue-black (one species has berries that are red when ripe), spherical berries, reddish or purple at first, grow 0.25 to 0.33 inch across, the size of (unrelated) blueberries, which they resemble. Growing in loose racemes, they also have a frilled “crown” at the tip, like blueberries. Inside are several soft, irregularly elliptoid, almond-flavored seeds.</field>

      <field name="harvesting"> And, as with most other wild foods, some years are better for juneberries than others, but you can usually harvest these berries in quantity without a huge amount of effort. Pull them off with your fingers, or use a saw-edged scoop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punch a hole in the top of a food container, insert a key ring and attach it to your belt with a key clip, to free both hands for picking. Bring additional food containers to transfer your harvest when your collection container and stomach are full.</field>
      <field name="cooking">This is simply one of the tastiest foods in the universe. Juneberries are usually exceptionally delicious—quite sweet, with the flavor of apples and blueberries, plus a hint of almonds from the soft seeds. Only a few varieties have bad-tasting fruits, but they're rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the berries raw in cereals, and bake them into muffins, pies, cakes, pancakes, and cobblers. They make a great jam, smoothies, and fruit sauces too, but there's virtually no dessert where they wouldn't be superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Juneberries contain pectin, so the puréed, cooked fruit will have some thickening properties, like apples.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Juneberries are loaded with anthocyanins, which reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes. They're an excellent source of vitamin E, and provide vitamins C and B1, folate, potassium, iron, magnesium, and manganese as well.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Beware—these berries taste so good, they can make you die of happiness. Also, they can cause hair-loss—but only if you're a botanist trying to figure out which species is which—through excessive head-scratching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no poisonous look-alikes, since no poisonous berry has a “crown,” but you can't go around eating any berries that are blue-colored, since there are bushes with poisonous berries that don't resemble juneberries at all but are colored blue.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">The juneberries' fruit resembles that of blueberries (&lt;i&gt;Vaccinium spp.&lt;/i&gt;), but those delicious wild berries have no detectable seeds, the shrubs don't have gray bark, and the flowers are bell-shaped.</field>

So after 29 years of leading foraging tours, I only once got a really good harvest.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Peel and discard the tough skin, and enjoy the pulp, without the seeds, raw or cooked. It tastes like lemon custard. If you’re preparing it in quantity, simmer the coarsely-cut fruit for 5 to 10 minutes in fruit juice or non-dairy milk with a sweetener, along with a thickener if applicable, then use a food mill to remove the seeds, or remove them by hand when cooled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thick, tart pulp makes a great lemon substitute, and it's wonderful in pie fillings, custards, cake toppings, puddings, beverages, jams, jelly, marmalade, and sauces. You may also freeze the pulp in ice cube trays, store the cubes in food containers in the freezer, and add the cubes to recipes as needed.</field>

Death can ensue within a few hours of ingestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even handling the rhizomes can create skin lesions, and getting any in your eyes will cause swelling, redness, and pain. And don't eat the thick skin of the ripe fruit, which may also be poisonous, or the hard seeds, which are poisonous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some sources claim the ripe fruit is poisonous if eaten in large quantity, but I only found enough to try this once.

      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">The berries ripen in late spring, and a few late trees still bear fruit into early summer. Yet my wife and I once inexplicably found a very unusual red mulberry tree in a the Cross County Shopping Mall in Westchester, NY, with ripe fruit in early fall, but that only happened once, and I've never heard of it elsewhere, so I'm not going to add it to the tally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young, developing leaves are edible from mid- to late spring.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Residential streets, backyards, vacant lots, disturbed habitats, parks, fields, edges of woods, open woods, and near lakes, ponds, and rivers</field>
      <field name="range">The red mulberry grows throughout most of Eastern North America, the white mulberry grows throughout most of North America, but not Utah, the Texas mulberry grows in the Southwest, and the black mulberry grows in Texas, Louisiana, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">The red and Texas mulberries are native, the black and white mulberries are from Europe and Asia respectively.</field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">[Look down for a mess of squashed berries staining the sidewalk under a tree in late spring. Then look up for medium-sized trees with their vertical cracks or furrows on the bark, and an occasional orange-brown streak between the cracks. It has roughly oval, medium-sized, unlobed, mitten-shaped, or three-lobed, shiny, toothed, alternate, long-stalked leaves and small, soft, moist, spherical to cylindrical stalked multiple fruits, dark purple, pink, or white.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Mulberry bark has distinctive vertical cracks or furrows, with an occasional orange-brown streak between the cracks. The native red mulberry (&lt;i&gt;M. rubra&lt;/i&gt;) and the Asian white mulberry (&lt;i&gt;M. alba&lt;/i&gt;) are among the most common and widespread mulberry trees in North America. With rough, reddish-brown bark, the red mulberry reaches a height of about 65 feet, while the white mulberry, with rough, lighter, ochre-gray bark and spreading branches, only reaches 40 feet tall. Two additional similar species are the Texas mulberry (&lt;i&gt;M. microphylla&lt;/i&gt;) and the black mulberry (&lt;i&gt;M. nigra&lt;/i&gt;). All parts of mulberry trees exude a white, milky sap when injured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing two to eight inches long the roughly oval, toothed, alternate, shiny, long-stalked leaves, which turn yellow in autumn, may be unlobed, mitten-shaped, or three-lobed. The red mulberry’s leaves feel rough underneath, while the white mulberry’s are smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiny, yellow-white male and female flowers hang on separate, small, slender, inconspicuous spikes in mid-spring, while the leaves are still developing. The male's cluster is longer, 0.5 inch long, while the female's is shorter and rounder, 0.25 inch long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The female flowers develop into spherical to cylindrical multiple fruits 0.5 to 1.5 inches long, each hanging individually from a slender, short fruit stalk. The fruit starts green. The white mulberries turn white and get soft and sticky. Also sticky when ripe, red mulberries become white, pink, reddish, purple, and finally nearly black. Hybrids of these species produce soft, sticky pink fruit.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Because these trees are so common, it isn't hard to find some growing away from heavy traffic with especially tasty fruit (quality varies from year to year, and trees with the largest berries in full sunlight are usually the best), and branches within reach. Although you can collect (or eat) the berries one at a time, it's more efficient to spread a medium-gauge, eight by 12 foot drop cloth, available in hardware stores, under the branches, and shake down the berries. If it's windy, put rocks or other weights on the corners of the drop cloth so it doesn't blow away. If you can climb the tree, you'll be able to shake more branches. Then carefully drag the drop cloth under other branches and repeat the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring lots of food containers. Your harvest may be immense. Pick over the contents of your drop cloth and remove any twigs leaves, and bugs [-(especially if you're a vegetarian!)] before gently transferring the fruit into your containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harvest after a period of sunny, dry weather, for the best berries. Rain washes away much of the flavor.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Mulberries have a wonderfully sweet flavor, a little like figs, to which they're related, but juicy. They're very perishable, and get moldy after more than three days in the refrigerator—probably the reason they're not sold commercially. Plan to eat, cook, dehydrate, or freeze mulberries before they spoil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place mulberries in a colander, and set the colander in a low bowl. Run lukewarm water through the colander, and the berries won't overflow, but you'll get rid of much of the debris. Drain, then spread a layer of the berries on a tray or cookie sheet and pick out the remaining debris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add some lemon or lime juice to mulberry recipes if desired, since they lack the acidity of most other berries, and use them like other berries, in fruit salads, pies, muffins, cakes, pancakes, ice cream, jam, cobblers, compotes, fruit soups, or beverages. Or spread them on a cookie sheet and freeze, then pack into freezer containers. This way they won't stick together, and you can defrost them as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Partially developed mulberry leaves are edible in early spring. Boiled them 20 minutes first and discard the water, which is somewhat toxic. The water and raw leaves, reputedly slightly hallucinogenic, produce such a bad headache and stomachache, that people who try to use them to get high once never seem to want to repeat the disaster!&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Mulberries contain high levels of anthocyanins, vitamin C, and the minerals calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Large quantities of mulberries are supposed to be laxative, but my tour participants and I eat them in quantity every year, and I've never noticed my groups shrinking as the foragers start making for the bushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t eat green, hard, dry, unripe mulberries (or any upripe fruit, for that matter). They can produce severe nausea, vomiting, and hallucinations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you live in Iserlohn, Germany, don’t tell your mother that you eat mulberries—she might forbid it, claiming that the Devil uses them to blacken his boots!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">The paper mulberry, (&lt;i&gt;Broussonetia papyrifera&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Morus papyrifera&lt;/i&gt;) has similar leaves, but they're very rough above and below. The frilly, red, spherical berry of this East Asian tree is edible, but I've never seen this tree, which has been planted in parks in NYC, bearing fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sassafras also has lobed and unlobed leaves, but, unlike mulberries, they’re fragrant and untoothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raspberry and blackberry fruits superficially resemble mulberries, but these unrelated thorny canes aren't trees, and the fruits grow upright, on receptacles, instead of hanging from fruit stalks, like mulberries do.</field>

      <field name="range">The pawpaw tree grows in the  Southeast and Midwest. Sadly, for reasons scientists are still debating, it's in decline, and its range is shrinking.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin"></field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a small tree or multi-branched shrub with bumpy gray and light brown bark, sometimes cracked. Slender, spreading-ascending branches hold large, dark green, smooth-edged, membranous, oblong to lance-shaped, drooping, alternate leaves and small clusters of medium-sized, six-petaled, velvety, bell-shaped, hairy-stalked flowers. The fruits are bumpy, flattened, yellow-green, brown-spotted, mango-sized and -shaped.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This small tree or multi-branched shrub, with slender, spreading-ascending branches, grows ten to 40 feet tall and eight to 12 inches wide. The gray and light brown bark is bumpy, patchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wider toward the tip and tapering toward the base, the large, thin, smooth-edged, membranous, oblong to lance-shaped, drooping, alternate leaves, dark green above and lighter below, grow from four inches to one foot long, and from two to six inches across. They smell like bell peppers when injured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As new leaves begin to develop in the spring, one to four maroon, six-petaled, velvety, bell-shaped, fetid-smelling, hairy-stalked flowers one to 1.5 inches across grow clustered in the axils of the previous year's growth, with three green, red-spotted sepals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The irregularly bumpy, oblong, aromatic, flattened, mango-sized and -shaped fruit grows from three to seven inches long and one to two inches thick, in clusters of two to nine.

      <field name="harvesting">You can collect pawpaws by hand and transfer them to food containers, or gently shake the branches over a drop cloth. Try not to break the pawpaws, or the oozing pulp will cause problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you live where critters can get the fruit, collect it unripe and store in a cool place until it ripens.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Peel pawpaws, discard the poisonous seeds, and use the pulp raw or cooked, like bananas. It has a banana’s texture, with overtones of pear, strawberry, pineapple, and mango. Try using the pulp in your favorite banana bread recipe, add it to smoothies, or use it in ice cream, muffins, cakes, pies,  and puddings.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Pawpaws provide lots of vitamin C, magnesium, iron, copper, and manganese, as well as potassium, several essential amino acids, and significant amounts of vitamins B2 and B3, phosphorus, and zinc, plus more calories than most edible wild plants. They also contain the enzyme papain, which aids protein digestion.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Paw-paws may be slightly laxative and sedative, so don't drive a car after you've eaten them until you determine whether they'll make you fall asleep on the way to the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toxic fresh or tinctured seeds are emetic and produce a stupor, and should be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, eating pawpaws can cause nausea and vomiting susceptible people, so eat very small quantities the first time, and gradually increase your portion sizes. After I had no reaction the first time I ate a small serving, I made a pawpaw smoothie, drank a whole glassful, and promptly threw up—the only time I ever experienced a bad reaction from a wild food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't go "picking up pawpaws and putting them in your pocket," as the traditional song goes, or the oozing pulp will ruin your pants!</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Pick peaches from the branches or the ground, separate the ripe from unripe fruit (which ripens at room temperature) and transfer to food containers. Wild peaches are much more delicate than commercial peaches, so proceed carefully. Use the good parts of trimmed damaged peaches.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Subject to natural selection rather than being selected by business for durability, wild peaches are far juicier and sweeter than commercial peaches, although you'll have more trouble shipping or storing them for the market.  Just trim away any damaged parts, and be prepared for peaches that are way tastier than the ones you buy. Enjoy them raw, put them in fruit- or mixed salads, slice them onto cereals, and use them in pies, puddings, jam, ice cream, cobblers, shakes, and cakes.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Peaches provide vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, and C, beta-carotene and folate, plus the minerals potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, selenium, and zinc.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Don’t eat the raw kernel inside the pit. It contains amygdalin and hydrocyanic acid, which can potentially turn into cyanide, although they're destroyed by heat.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Nectarines are smooth-skinned peaches, not a cross between peaches and plums as is commonly believed. I've only found 1 such wild tree, in Central Park, where it produced great crops year after year until sadly, its short lifespan came to an end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wild apricot tree (&lt;i&gt;P. armeniaca&lt;/i&gt;) is a small tree, with medium-sized, simple, alternate, wedge-shaped, finely-toothed leaves, and spherical, orange fruits, smaller than peaches.  Another escape from cultivation, it's supposed to grow in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, California, and Oregon, but I found two trees in separate locations in Marine Park, Brooklyn, near the seashore, so they could be growing in sandy fields and thickets anywhere apricot-eating people tossed away the pits.</field>

Looks like an initial mistake has been repeated repeatedly without anyone tasting the fruit in questions.

The only drawback is that they're too small and sparse to collect in quantity so I use as a trail nibble and a garnish.</field>

      <field name="placeOfOrigin">The center of diversity for this genus is in Mexico.</field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for stands of cacti consisting of flattened pads connected by flattened joints, with a few spines emerging from small, dark bumps. Showy, yellow flowers with many petals grow at tips of the pads with elongated, egg-shaped fruits, narrowing at the base and wider at tip. They give way to elongated, egg-shaped fruits, narrowing at the base and wider at tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON'T  feel for the tiny, barely visible, painfully prickly spines that cover this plant!</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">These low-growing cacti consist of fleshy pads separated by flattened joints. Prickly, easily detachable bristles, almost too fine to see, called glochids, cover the whole plant, including the fruits, as do a few smooth, fixed spines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Showy, radially-symmetrical, yellow flowers three to five inches across, with ten to 12 petals, grow on the pads’ upper segments in early summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Club-shaped, dull red-purple fruits ripen from late summer through autumn, persisting into the winter. Flat on top and tapering toward the bottom, they grow from one to two inches long and about 0.75 inch across. Many hard, flattened, nearly circular seeds grow inside the red pulp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more prickly than picking up this plant without protection is trying to differentiate the 200 species, especially since they hybridize readily. Fortunately, they're all edible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eastern prickly pear or devil's tongue (&lt;i&gt;O. humifusa&lt;/i&gt;), with brick red fruit, is prostrate, growing up to eight inches long. I've found it in dunes along the seashore in NYC, where it's rare, but it's much more common from the coastal NJ to the Gulf Coast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Various Western species may be tall or short, and the fruit may be yellow, red, purple, or white. The most common of these, the tulip prickly pear (&lt;i&gt;O. phaeacantha&lt;/i&gt;), grows up to three feet tall when it's not prostrate. With pads sometimes over one foot across, and larger, juicier, more abundant fruit, it's better than the Eastern species. Engelman’s prickly pear (&lt;i&gt;O. engelmannii&lt;/i&gt;), another Southwest species, is even larger, reaching four to ten feet tall.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Twist or cut off and collect the young pads and the ripe fruit wearing heavy-duty work gloves. Transfer them to containers, and avoid any contact with your skin until they've been processed.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Wearing heavy-duty work gloves, rub the fruit or pads vigorously with a damp towel to remove all the bristles, or place the fruit or pads on a stove burner and singe away the glochids over high heat, turning often with tongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor of the fruit ranges from bland to sweet and delicious. The Eastern species, with which I'm the most familiar, tastes like a pulpy combination of watermelon and blackberry. You can peel it, remove the sweet pulp, and eat it as is, or remove the seeds by hand (the plant gummed up my food mill) and use the pulp in fruit recipes. It’s great in sauces, puddings, jelly, and beverages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also dry the seeds and grind them, pre-roasted if desired, into a nutty-flavored flour, using a grain mill, blender, or coffee- or spice grinder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spring, the tender, young, new pads make a mild, mucilaginous green vegetable, much like okra. You'll love it if you like okra, but not if you hate okra. Add it to stews and soups, which it thickens, cooking in 15 to 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also fry strips of the pads, as people in Mexico do. If you don’t like the gummy texture, pre-boil the sliced pads 10 minutes, then rinse them before proceeding. </field>
      <field name="nutrition">The fruit is an excellent source of vitamin C, E, and carotinoids, the minerals calcium, potassium, and phosphorous, plus biothiols, taurine, and flavonols. The pads provide beta-carotene and potassium, and the seeds are high in protein and oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole plant, but especially the fruit, contain health-promoting antioxidants, including 3-methoxytyramine, candicine, hordenine, N-methyltyramine, tyramine, betanin, and indicaxanthin, although this varies from species to species. The take-home message: this plant is very good for you!</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">The glochids are harmless, but only so long as you don't touch them! Otherwise, always handle this plant with heavy-duty work gloves. If you do get the glochids in your skin, shine a bright light on the area and have someone with very good eyesight pull the prickles out, one by one, using tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eating too many prickly pear fruits gives some people constipation.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Dry, woody, inedible relatives, called chollas (&lt;i&gt;Cylindropuntia spp.&lt;/i&gt;), have cylindrical joints between the pads, not flattened joints like prickly pears. You can cook these, but then they come out like cooked wood!</field>

Simmer all ingredients together for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Blend briefly at low speed in a blender to loosen the seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Press the pulp through a sieve with a large rubber spatula to remove the seeds (or split the fruit in half with a knife and remove the seeds with a grapefruit spoon before cooking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes 1-1/4 cups&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparation/cooking time: 30 minutes</field>

      <field name="range">Eastern North America, the Great Lakes region, and southeastern Canada.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin"></field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a small tree or shrub with gray-brown bark that cracks with age. American mountain ash has hairless, alternate, feather-compound leaves consisting of 11 to 17 finely toothed leaflets that usually arch, and showy, flat-topped flower clusters of tiny, cream-white, five-petaled flowers. It's small, spherical, red-orange berries are in loose, branching clusters.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">The small tree or shrub grows from ten to 30 (rarely 40) feet tall, with a short trunk four to ten inches wide, slender, spreading branches, a narrow, open, rounded crown, and a spread of up to 15 feet. Smooth and spotted with lenticels when young, the gray-brown bark cracks and develops fissures and scaly patches with maturity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairless, feather-compound, alternate leaves grow six to 12 inches long, with 11 to 17 finely toothed, lance-shaped leaflets two to five inches long and 0.66 to one inch wide.  The slender, dark green or red leafstalk is grooved. Often arching, the leaflets are dark green above and pale green below. They turn dull red, purple, orange, or yellow in autumn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Showy, flat-topped clusters three to five inches across hold many small, creamy-white five-petaled flowers 0.125 inch across, from late spring to early summer, to be replaced by clusters of seedy, red-orange, spherical berries, 0.25 to 0.75 inches across, in the fall and winter.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Plan your harvest when it's above 40 degrees F if possible, so you can work without gloves. Break off bunches of berries and transfer them to food containers. You can remove the berries from the stalks at home.</field>
      <field name="cooking">After it's been subjected to frost, the fruit is tasty cooked, somewhat similar to crab apples &lt;i&gt;(Malus spp.)&lt;/i&gt; Otherwise, the tannin content makes it too astringent to enjoy. Cooked, sweetened, and strained of its seeds, it's similar to applesauce, edible on its own, and a good addition to cookies or pies.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">This fruit contains vitamin C and iron.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">The raw seeds, which are too hard to eat, have the potential to release cyanide. Don't separate them from the fruit, grind them up, and force yourself swallow large quantities of them without cooking them (which destroys the poison) first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't travel to the Himalayas, where there are very many similar-looking relatives—trying to figure out which is which may cause you to die of confusion!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">The mountain ash isn't an ash. True ash trees ( &lt;i&gt;Fraxinus spp.&lt;/i&gt;) have smooth, rather than toothed leaves, and they don't have berries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The European mountain ash (&lt;i&gt;S. aucuparia&lt;/i&gt;), also called the rowan tree, is very similar to its American relative, with edible orange berries, but it grows only under cultivation in North America. And it's winter buds are hairless, while the American mountain ash's are fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The northern mountain ash (&lt;i&gt;S. decora&lt;/i&gt;) is another close relative, but with hair on the leaves' undersides, which the American mountain ash lacks, and edible bright red rather than red-orange berries. It grows in mountainous areas in the Northeast and Canada. Five more similar but smaller native species (&lt;i&gt;Sorbus spp.&lt;/i&gt;), again with edible, red berries, grow in Western North America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Twist the ripe fruits off the branches and transfer them to food containers or bags. If not completely ripe, leave them in a bowl at room temperature until ripe, or place them in a bag with apples, which speeds ripening.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The fruits are too hard, bitter, and astringent to enjoy raw, but cooked 15 to 10 minutes with other fruits and a sweetener, they impart a wonderful citrus-like flavor. Use them as a minor ingredient in pies, fruit soups, or compotes. They're especially good in desserts that include raisins. Because they contain pectin, like apples, they're also good for making jams and jellies.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Quinces are a good source of vitamins A, B3, C, and folate, as well as the minerals calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">The fruit is considered analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, astringent, and digestive. A decoction has been used to treat nausea, joint pains, and cholera. Since it's used for food, it's known to be safe, but it still requires testing for effectiveness. Unfortunately, it's hard to get a volunteer willing to become infected with cholera!</field>

You can cook them, like other greens, 10 to 15 minutes, but they'll lose their spicy flavor, which is destroyed by heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make prepared horseradish, a wonderful, pungent condiment, just grate the roots and cover them with vinegar immediately, before they darken, lose their pungency, and become bitter—caused by exposure to air. Prepared horseradish lasts indefinitely in the refrigerator. Add it to any dish that needs some pungency at the table, and don't cook it, or you’ll destroy its flavor too.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Horseradish leaves and roots provide vitamins B2, C, pantothenic acid, and folate, plus the minerals calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and selenium.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Use horseradish as a condiment only. In large amounts, the glucosinolates it contains can cause profuse sweating, irritation of the stomach and intestines, loss of strength, and disorientation, something you definitely want to avoid. I should know—I experienced these symptoms every time we had a math test in high school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prolonged contact of the root with the skin will cause it to blister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't use this plant if you have stomach ulcers or thyroid problems.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Wear long pants and sleeves, plus heavy-duty work gloves, for protection against the thorns, and bring tweezers just in case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick the roses with your gloved fingers, and a knife or garden shears, and transfer them into plastic bags you can seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choose species with the largest fruits. Pick only ripe hips. They're deeply colored and somewhat soft, without green. Twist off the fruit or cut it with a knife or garden shears. </field>
      <field name="cooking">The flowers of roses are edible, and while some people love them, I've never found them very tasty, and people who cook with them tend to drown them in sugar. You can add the petals to salads or dessert dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fruit of some of the larger species is usually quite good (some species taste terrible), with a flavor and texture similar to apricots, and it contains pectin, the same substance that thickens applesauce. Unfortunately, rose hips are labor-intensive to process. You have to cut them in half and scoop out the hard, bitter, non-poisonous white seeds. I use a paring knife and grapefruit spoon for this. You can also cook whole rose hips in fruit juice for 20 minutes or until tender, then strain out the seeds with a food mill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy rose hips raw or add them to puddings, cakes, cookies, sauces, compotes, jam, fruit soups, ice cream, breads, or other dessert recipes. They also make an excellent herb tea, covered with boiling water and steeped for 20 minutes—the best way to use for those species with tiny rose hips.</field>
      <field name="nutrition"> Rose hips are an excellent source of vitamins A, B3, C, E, and K, plus the minerals calcium, manganese, and zinc, as well as pectin, malic and citric acids, fructose, and sucrose, bioflavonoids, carotenoids, anthocyanins, catechins and other polyphenolics.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Rose hips were used to treat scurvy, which their vitamin C cured. Eating the fruit is good for diarrhea, and it's been used to help people digest rich foods. It's also been used as an anti-inflammatory for arthritis , and it's currently being investigated for anti-cancer properties. Herbalists prescribed rose hips for infections, chest congestion, and bladder problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Chinese traditional medicine, an infusion of the flowers is used for poor circulation, stomachaches, liver pains, mastitis, dysentery, vaginal yeast infections, and pregnancy.</field>

      <field name="slug">sumac</field>


      <field name="group">&lt;i&gt;Anacardiaceae&lt;/i&gt;, the cashew family or sumac family</field>
      <field name="plantType"/>
      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">The berries of various sumac species come into season from late summer through fall. Smooth sumac and squawbush ripen in late summer, staghorn sumac ripens in early fall, and winged sumac ripens in mid-fall. And you can harvest the edible young shoots in the spring.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Staghorn, smooth, and winged sumac all grow in full or partial sunlight, in old fields, thickets, edges of woods, disturbed areas, canyons, stream banks, roadsides, dry sandy or rocky soil, and near the seashore. Skunkbush grows on slopes, plains, and canyons.</field>
      <field name="range">Various sumac species grow throughout North America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winged and staghorn sumac grow throughout Eastern and Central North America. Smooth sumac grows throughout North America. Skunkbush grows in the western half of the US, but it's also planted in parks on the East Coast—I've seen it in Central Park.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin"></field>
      <field name="native">1</field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for dense stands of small trees or shrubs, with stout twigs that exude white sap. Sumac usually has long, feather-compound leaves, upright terminal spikes or panicles with many tiny, yellow to green-yellow, five-petaled flowers, and upright fruit clusters consisting of many tiny, spherical, hard, red berries.</field>

      <field name="positiveId">•Small trees or large shrubs with stout twigs exuding white sap when cut&lt;br /&gt;•Usually very large, feather-compound (sometimes palmate-compound) leaves, usually fragrant when cut&lt;br /&gt;•Upright panicles or spikes of many tiny, yellow or green-yellow, five-petaled flowers&lt;br /&gt;•Dense, upright clusters tiny, hard, spherical, red or red-orange berries</field>
      <field name="harvesting">The best time to harvest the ripe berries is after a prolonged dry spell. The worst time is the day after it's rained, when most of the flavor has been washed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best berries are brightly colored and dotted with whitish deposits of tasty acid. Pinch a berry and touch your finger to your tongue. You should detect a strong, sour flavor. This means it's harvest time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut off the red seed heads with garden shears or a knife and transfer them to a bag, or twist and break them off with your hands. </field>
      <field name="cooking">Don't rinse off these berries before use or you'll wash all the flavor down the drain. The best-known way to use sumac is by making a wonderfully flavored pink lemonade with it. Submerge the berry cluster (minus any six- or eight-legged stragglers) in a bowl of room temperature or warm water, and squeeze and twist it with your hands for a minute or so (you may also steep the clusters in hot water, but lemonade is better cold). Strain out the berries through a fine sieve or cheesecloth-lined colander, sweeten to taste, and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also make sumac concentrate, which you can use like lemon or lime juice (see recipe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young growth at the tips of the plants—the shoots, are also edible, raw or cooked, after you peel them. They make quite a tasty vegetable you can use in a variety of dishes.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Sumac is an excellent source of vitamin C. Most colorful fruits contain healthy proanthocyanins, but sumac hasn't been tested for these yet.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes">1</field>
      <field name="cautions">Sumac is related to cashews, mangoes, and poison ivy. If you're you're so sensitive to poison ivy that you can't eat cashews or mangoes, you should avoid sumac too.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">In the Middle East, people use dried, ground sumac berries as a seasoning. That works with the species that grow there, but not with American ones, which have hard, stony seeds inside the berries. However, you can usually substitute Sumac Concentrate in recipe that calls for sumac, with good results. Just subtract a volume of liquid in the recipe equal to that of the Sumac Concentrate you're adding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black walnut tree has leaves similar to sumac's, but it's a much larger tree with different flowers, and edible nuts rather than berries in the fall. Also, the leaf doesn't exude a white sap, as sumac does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The similar-looking leaf of the ailanthus tree (&lt;i&gt;Ailanthus altissima&lt;/i&gt;) smells like rotten peanut butter and doesn't exude a white sap. Again, all other features are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mountain ashes or rowan trees also have similar leaves, but again, no milky sap, and much larger, round, red or orange edible berries.</field>
      <field name="poisonousLookalikes">Make sure the flower clusters are upright, and the clusters of berries are upright and red or red-orange. Poison sumac (&lt;i&gt;Rhus vernix&lt;/i&gt;) has drooping clusters of white berries, quite different from the edible species. Touch it, and you'll have a severe rash for a month that can recur over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poison oak has leaves similar to skunkbush, but the flowers are small and inconspicuous, and the berries are yellow-brown, not red.</field>
      <field name="poisonous"></field>
      <field name="poisonousPart"></field>
      <field name="commonNames">Smooth sumac is also called red sumac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winged sumac is also called dwarf sumac or shining sumac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skunkbush is also called sourberry, three-leaf sumac, and squawbush.</field>

Its only virtue, besides its rarity, is that it makes its relative, poison ivy, look like a minor annoyance in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive people may get rashes just from being near this plant. And once you touch it and the toxin, urushiol, enters your bloodstream, you get a painful rash that can continue for weeks, spread all over your body, and recur for months. And breathing the smoke from burning poison sumac can cause death. Give me poison ivy any day!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Edible sumacs (&lt;i&gt;Rhus spp.&lt;/i&gt;) have upright flower- and fruit clusters, not drooping ones like poison sumac. Their berries are red, not white, and there aren't large spaces between the leaflets.</field>

Cook them with a sweetener, add a thickener if desired, and strain out the seeds using a food mill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thickened, sweetened purée makes a great alternative to cranberry sauce, especially seasoned with sweet spices such as mint, cinnamon, sassafras, orange rind, ginger, or cloves. You use it in pies, breads, ice cream, cakes, puddings. It's especially good in chocolate desserts, where the two very different flavorful ingredients complement each other perfectly.</field>

      <field name="similarPlants">Unrelated true cranberries (&lt;i&gt;Vaccinium spp.&lt;/i&gt;) also have red, sour-flavored berries, but that's where the resemblance ends. Real cranberries creep along the ground, with small, unlobed leaves, completely different flowers, and no large stone in the fruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guilder rose or cramp bark (&lt;i&gt;V. opulus&lt;/i&gt;) also looks very much like the highbush cranberry, from the leaves to the non-poisonous but unpalatable berries. A decoction of the cambium of this European cultivated ornamental, while inferior to its edible American relative, the black haw (&lt;i&gt;V. prunifolium&lt;/i&gt;), is a traditional home remedy for menstrual cramps. And this one really works—ever since I've learned it, I go through month after month without ever experiencing a single cramp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to tell these close relatives (which some botanists consider subspecies of each other) apart is by examining the tiny glands on the leafstalks. Guider rose has bowl-shaped glands, while highbush cranberry's are dome-shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maple-leaf viburnum (&lt;i&gt;V. acerifolium&lt;/i&gt;), on the other hand, is a related shrub with similar leaves but hard, blue-black, inedible berries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The linden viburnum (&lt;i&gt;V. dilatatum&lt;/i&gt;), has broadly oval to elliptical, coarsely toothed, finely fuzzy, pointed leaves three to five inches long that resemble those of the linden tree. Showy, flat-topped cymes three to five inches across with white, five-petaled flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, replaced by bright red, showy autumn berries 0.33 inch long. While they're edible and strongly lemon flavored, they're too small, and the seeds are too large, for more than a sour trail nibble or tea, although kids who like sour flavors can't get enough of them.</field>

      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Asia</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a commonly cultivated bush or tree with thin, reddish-brown, scaly bark, then short, flat, lance-shaped needles and tiny, inconspicuous, cream-colored flowers. The round, red, juicy, mucilaginous, cup-shaped berries each have a single, round, black seed visible.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This dense, medium-sized evergreen shrub (its most usual form) or tree's thin, reddish-brown, scaly bark covers a purple-red cambium. Growing 10 to 25 (sometimes  50) feet tall, its spread equals or surpasses its height. As a tree, its trunk can grow to nearly two feet across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its short, flat, singly attached, straight or curved, sharply pointed, lance-shaped needles grow 0.5 to one inch long and 0.1 inch wide, in V-shaped rows. Dark green and shiny above and pale green below, the spirally configured leaves generally twist to grow in 1 plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiny, inconspicuous, cream-colored male flowers, growing in groups, produce clouds of pollen during a period of about one week in early spring. The tiny, solitary female flower grow on separate bushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spherical, juicy, mucilaginous red berries 0.25 inch across, form a round cup around a single, hard, round, black seed.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Simply remove the berries from the bush and transfer them to plastic containers, avoiding unripe fruit. Freeing both hands by stringing a container and tying it to your belt, or wearing it around your neck, makes collection faster.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The sweet berries taste like jelly, and make an outstanding trail nibble and snack food. Cooking with them is way too dangerous due to the possibility of deadly toxins escaping from the seeds, and the pulp is too gelatinous to let you remove the seeds by hand. You simply have to eat the pulp and spit out the seeds.</field>
      <field name="nutrition"></field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Taxol, a substance found in all yews in minute quantities, is used to treat breast and ovarian cancer, and it's extended the lives of many cancer patients. It's now semi-synthesized in pharmaceutical labs, but can't be separated from the deadly toxins without a state-of-the-art pharmaceutical laboratory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another substance extracted from yews is being researched to treat diabetes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Native Americans used a decoction of various parts of the yew to treat a variety of diseases, and even though they took this in minute quantities, it's way to dangerous to use as a home remedy today.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">If you chew and eat the seeds in these berries, you'll die. Remember: nothing is certain but death and &lt;i&gt;Taxus!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Spit out the very deadly seeds when you eat the flesh, and don't eat them within sight of any young children, who could imitate you and swallow the seeds. It's possible that if you swallow a seed without chewing it, it will pass through your digestive system without killing you, but it's also possible that you could play Russian roulette and survive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seeds contain cardiac alkaloids that can stop your heart, and chewing them releases the poisons more quickly. Only one person on Earth can chew and swallow the seeds: my ex-girlfriend of nearly 10 years, who ran off with another guy on Valentine's Day in 1995—she has no heart!</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Strip off the young leaves, and pick the flowers and fruits with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easiest way to dig up the roots is with a shovel.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The young leaves make a good cooked vegetable in soups, stews, sauces, or a variety of side dishes and entrées. They're somewhat bland, so include more flavorful ingredients or herbs and spices. They add the thickening properties of okra to any dish containing liquids, and cook in about 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not harmful eaten raw, their fuzzy texture isn't especially enjoyable, so use the leaves sparingly in salads. The flowers are better in salads, while the fruits are best cooked, like the leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The root is too fibrous to eat. People used to boil it, then boil down the liquid, sweeten it, and beat it into a meringue. That's how the familiar confection first came into being. Because the plant is rare in my area, I've never had the opportunity to dig up the root to try this. </field>
      <field name="nutrition">Marshmallow leaves are a good source of vitamin C, the minerals iron and calcium, plus copper and other trace minerals.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">The whole plant, which contains mucilage, has been used medicinally since ancient times. The roots contain pectin, asparagine, and tannins, while the leaves contain flavanoids such a kaempferol, plus quercitin, diosmetin, glucosides, and coumarin, as well as polyphenolic acids such as syringic, caffeic, salicyclic, vanillic, and p-coumaric acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The root is a demulcent, emmolient, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and expectorant. A decoction of the roots is used for digestive and skin problems, and for inflammations of the mouth and throat, gastritis, peptic ulcers, enteritis, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, and colitis. It's also supposedly increases the flow of breast milk, but this has never worked for me. Externally, it's used for treating varicose veins, ulcers, abscesses, bruises, sprains, aching muscles, insect bites, skin inflammations, splinters, and boils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An infusion of the leaves is used for lung problems such as bronchitis, as well as for urinary tract problems such as cystitis, urethritis, gravel, and kidney stones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the plant seems to be a tried and true safe and effective home remedy for minor complaints, it should be used in conjunction with medical supervision for serious conditions, where, if the plant fails, the disease can do serious harm.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Collect from the ground or the tree, using two double shopping bags (pears are heavy), to keep ripe and unripe fruit separate. </field>
      <field name="cooking">Wild pears, which arise from seeds, not from cuttings like commercial clones, have genetic variety that makes them more like the hard, ancestral wild varieties than the pears you buy in the store—heartier, grittier, less juicy, and best cooked. Use them for pies, cakes, compotes, fruit soups, sauces, puddings, cobblers, and other desserts. They cook in 15 to 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use or refrigerate the ripe pears immediately. Sort the unripe ones every day until the last pear ripens. Use or refrigerate the ripe ones, and throw out any that are becoming rotten before they contaminate the good ones. Storing pears with bananas, which give off ethylene gas, speeds ripening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also eat ripe callery pears as is or cook them with a sweetener and seasonings, then remove the grit and seeds with a food mill, to make a delicious pear sauce.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">The skin of pears provide vitamin C, and the minerals potassium, calcium, and phosphorous. Peel them and the nutrients are gone.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Pears have been used medicinally since ancient times, when the Greeks treated nausea with pears. Pears' insoluble fiber makes them good for constipation, and may even reduce the number of precancerous colon polyps. People have eaten pears to treat inflammation of the mucous membranes, and for colitis, chronic gallbladder problems, arthritis, and gout. They may lower high blood pressure, reduce HDL (bad) cholesterol, and even increase the urine's acidity, although more testing is needed.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Never try to swallow a thrown pear that you catch in your mouth. Drussus, the son of the Roman emperor Claudius, tried that, and he choked to death!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Apple trees look similar to pear trees, but pear trees have thicker, often darker twigs that are thinner and more gnarled than apples— sometimes even spiny. And apple flowers are pink, not white. Pears are gritty above the core, apples aren't. If you still can't tell the difference between an apple and a pear, put them in water. Pears sink, while apples float!</field>

New growth from the perennial roots occurs the first year. Side branches with flowers and berries arise on the these during the second year, after which it dies back to the roots, to repeat the cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The palmate-compound alternate leaves, which grow from four to seven inches long, consist of three large, broadly oval, sharply toothed, pointy tipped, papery leaflets, green above, and whitish beneath due to a mat of wooly hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in mid-spring, flowers bloom on very bristly many-flowered panicles at the tips of the second year's side shoots. The sepals are long enough to enclose the immature flowers. Each inconspicuous, white flower grows 0.2 to 0.4 inch across, with five tiny, oval petals, within the five long, narrow, triangular, bristly sepals, which form a star nearly an inch across, on a densely prickly, red flower stalk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sepals close over the flower after fertilization too, and don't open until the aggregate fruit is nearly ripe. Orange before ripening, the bright red to dark purple-red, juicy, spherical berries, 1 inch or more in diameter, grow in small clusters. An orange receptacle is left behind after you pick the hollow berry.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Plan your harvest in advance, choosing a relatively cool day, and forage early in the morning, so you can wear long pants and sleeves to protect yourself from thorns and mosquitoes without getting too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punch a hole in the top of a food container, insert a key ring and attach it to your belt with a key clip, to free both hands for picking. Wear heavy-duty work gloves with the fingertips of your picking hand's glove cut off (kitchen shears will do this) to protect your hands as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick as many of the most dark red-purple berries as possible. They're the tastiest. When your container and stomach are full, transfer your harvest into one of your empty containers and resume picking.</field>
      <field name="cooking">These are especially tasty raspberries, much more flavorful and acidic than the ones you buy, although they contain hard seeds which you should strain out in any recipe where the fruit will be puréed, i.e., jams. Otherwise, use wineberries in any manner of dessert. The results are always astonishing.</field>

      <field name="cooking">The berries' familiar, refreshing flavor makes them ideal for salads and fruit dishes, cereals, puddings, jello, pies, cakes, and sauces. They're small and labor-intensive to collect, so they're best used as a minor ingredient or garnish. They compliment sweet, juicy fruits especially well.

      <field name="medicinalUses">An infusion of any of the above-ground parts of this plant contains oil of wintergreen, a.k.a. methyl salicylate, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and the chemical forerunner of aspirin. It was used by the Indians for pain and inflammation, although you'll need many cups of tea to equal over-the-counter pain killers. Low dose aspirin, on the other hand, is prescribed heart disease, to thin the blood and prevent clots from causing heart attacks and strokes, but aspirin increases the risk of internal bleeds that could lead to gastrointestinal ulcers and strokes. A couple of cups of strong wintergreen tea a day could have the same protective effect, there's no documented evidence of such side effects, and it tastes good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tea is also considered an analgesic, astringent, carminative, diuretic, stimulant, tonic, and emmenagogue. Women used the infusion internally for delayed, irregular, or painful menstruation and to ease the pain of childbirth. People have also used the tea as a mouth rinse and gargle, and chewing the leaves or eating the berries has been used for bad breath, to soothe irritated gums, and for canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil of wintergreen, a concentrate you'd have to buy, has been used externally as a balm, liniment, or ointment. It’s been an ingredient in massage oils for decades, and has been used externally for headaches, arthritis, neuralgia, hives, swelling, and sore nipples. It's supposed to be a counterirritant, alterative, painkiller, antiseptic,  deobstruent, depurative, diaphoretic, diuretic, parasiticide, pectoral, stomachic, and vulnerary, so it has also used externally for burns, chafing, cholera, colds, cough, dandruff, diarrhea, dysentery, dysmenorrhea, gout, gravel, lumbago, rheumatism, scalds, sciatica,  sores, and more, but without supporting evidence.</field>

      <field name="howToSpot">Look for an herbaceous plant, a small shrub, or a long creeping and climbing, hairy-looking woody vine. It's stalked, alternate, three-parted, palmate-compound leaves are composed of three shiny, oval, toothless or sparely toothed leaflets with a long leafstalk on the leading leaflet. Loose, branching clusters of small, inconspicuous green-white, yellow-centered flowers hang with and pendant clusters of densely packed, small, dry, hard, spherical, cream-white berries.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Here's the plant I'm sure you're just itching to discover! People have trouble recognizing it because it takes several forms. It can grow as a small, harmless-looking herbaceous plant. It may be a small shrub with smooth, gray bark that can grow up to four feet tall (although increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is making it quite larger and much more toxic), and can carpet a forest floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It often takes the form of a coarsely hairy-looking vine with a trunk up to six inches across, that can trail four to ten feet, cover fences, or climb 150 feet high. The hairs are actually aerial roots which anchor the vine to whatever it's growing on, taking sunlight, but no nutrients, from its support structure. The other forms have these roots too, but they're small and inconspicuous, so you have to look for them—important for recognizing the gray shrub form, with small orange-brown buds, in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stalked, alternate, three-parted palmate-compound leaves consist of two lateral, short-stalked leaflets pointing in opposite directions, and one long-stalked leading leaflet perpendicular to the other two. With pointed tips and rounded bases, the oval leaflets, which sometimes have a few coarse, irregular teeth, can grow from four to 14 inches long. The point of convergence of the three leafstalks is always red. The shiny leaflets themselves are red while they're still developing, in early spring, and when they change color in the fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blooming in late spring and summer, loose, branching inconspicuous clusters of flowers with 5 green-white, oval petals surrounding a yellow center, grow on lateral stems arising from the leaf axils. They’re replaced by hanging clusters of small, dry, hard, spherical, ivory-white berries, 0.25 inch across, that ripen in late summer and fall, and sometimes persist into the winter.</field>

      <field name="cautions">The plant contains a yellow, lacquer-like phenolic compound called urushiol, which contains pentadecylcatechols that provoke severe allergic reactions in humans only, in the form of skin blistering contact dermatitis, usually within one to 12 hours. The oil also spreads through the blood, so you may also break out where you haven’t touched the plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although some people aren't allergic to poison ivy, if they keep exposing themselves to it, they may become sensitive. Even contact with a dog that has run through poison ivy can cause a rash. So learn the plant, actively look for it, and avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing with regular soap, which contains oils, after exposure, spreads the oily poison. Washing with an oil-free detergent soap, sold in drugstores as poison ivy soap, helps prevent the rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes people on my tours don't heed my warnings, and contact poison ivy. I have them rub any exposed surfaces with the liquid from the stem of jewelweed right away, and their skin remains unaffected, even though their behavior was rash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jewelweed also helps half the people who try it after the rash has developed. Otherwise, the best home remedies are oatmeal and baking soda. For severe cases, medical intervention with immune system-suppressant steroids is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people eat small amounts of very young poison ivy leaves to desensitize themselves to the toxin. This sometimes works. Other times, you get a very bad rash where the poison ivy enters the body, and a much worse rash where it exits the body at the other end (the treatment backfires!)  In extreme cases, your throat becomes so swollen that you can't breath! Likewise, burning poison ivy and breathing in the smoke can be fatal. There's only 1 person who'd be unaffected: Bill Clinton—he doesn't inhale!</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Poison ivy is not related to the true ivies (&lt;i&gt;Hedera spp.&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blackberries and raspberries (&lt;i&gt;Rubus spp.&lt;/i&gt;) have three-, five-, or seven-parted palmate compound leaves that look a little like poison ivy's, especially the three-parted ones, but, unlike poison ivy, these plants, which have edible berries, are prickly, and their leaves are strongly toothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hog peanut, with a 3-parted palmate-compound leaf, grows in the same habitat as poison ivy, but it's a slender, sparsely branched, hairy, twining vine, and the leaflets are never even slightly toothed.</field>

      <field name="cautions">Poison hemlock contains the alkaloid toxins coniine, N-methyl coniine, conhydrine, lambda-coniceine, and pseudoconhydrine. Eating even small amounts of this plant depresses the central nervous system, and can cause salivation, vomiting, diarrhea, muscular weakness, paralysis, nervousness, trembling, dilation of the pupils, weak pulse, convulsions, and coma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death usually occurs due to respiratory failure, as the brain can no longer signal the lungs to breath, but 1 person wouldn't be harmed by this plant:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George W.

      <field name="similarPlants">People have confused wild carrots (&lt;i&gt;Daucus carota&lt;/i&gt;) or Queen Anne's Lace with poison-hemlock, but unlike wild carrots, poison hemlock has smooth hollow stalks with purple blotches, and no hairs on its stems. Also, poison hemlock can get up to eight feet tall or higher, while wild carrots don't grow more than three feet tall. Poison hemlock produces many flowers per flower head rather than one, and there's never a purple flower in the center of the flower head, as there is with many wild carrot flowers. Poison hemlock also begins flowering in the spring, not in the summer, like wild carrots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No related plant's feather-compound leaves as large as poison hemlock's.</field>

      <field name="cautions">North America's most deadly plant, water hemlock contains cicutoxin, a clear, brown resin, and cicutol, toxins so powerful that eating one mouthful of any part of the plant can be fatal. Symptoms include severe stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, pupil dilation, difficulty breathing, frothing at the mouth, violent convulsions, and death within anywhere from 15 minutes or eight hours. After chewing their tongues to ribbons, victims may asphyxiate on their own vomit, unable to unclench their jaws. But on the plus side, the roots reportedly taste good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no antidote to the poison, but with prompt medical treatment in the form of supportive therapy, recovery may occur within 24 hours, although neurological damage sometimes remains.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Other related plants resemble water hemlock. The wild parsnip, which you can eat without dying, has once-divided feather-compound leaves rather than two or three times divided leaves. The flowers are yellow rather than white, the stem isn't hollow, and there's a single taproot rather than bundles. The cow parsnip, another edible relative, has white flowers, but again, the leaves are once-compound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water parsnip (&lt;i&gt;Sium sauve&lt;/i&gt;), has a strongly ridged stem and twice-compound, not three times compound, leaves. Its finely cut basal leaves, often submerged, grow from a single root, not a bundle, like water hemlock. But the flowers are similar, and it grows in the same habitat as water hemlock, sometimes side by side. Although it's edible, the risk of confusing the two plants is great enough that inexperienced foragers should avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have poisoned themselves mistaking this plant with wild carrots, which have lacy, finely cut leaves and a single main taproot that smells like carrots—quite dissimilar from this plant, but apparently not dissimilar enough!</field>

Otherwise slice them, peel if necessary, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes in soups and stews. Salsify reminds some people of the flavor of oysters, and it's great in mock seafood dishes, along with edible seaweeds, which increase the seafood flavor. It's also superb cream of potato soup and similar creamy dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people also roast the roots until black, grind them, and use them as a coffee substitute.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Salsify root provides vitamins B6, B2, C, E, K, and folate, plus the minerals calcium, iron magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as the trace minerals copper, selenium, and zinc.</field>

You can sometimes collect the young stem leaves throughout the growing season if they're not too bitter, although they seem to gain and lose their bitterness sporadically.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Sunny and partially shaded areas, on disturbed soil, along roadsides, in meadows and fields, near the seashore, in cracks in the sidewalk, and often against walls, where it’s less likely to be cut down</field>
      <field name="range">Common sow thistle grows throughout most of North America.</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Eurasia</field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for a basal rosette with roughly oval, hairless, bristly, stalked, deeply toothed, dull blue-green leaves. Later, look for a tall stem that branches very little below the flowers. It has broad-based, triangular-lobed, stalkess, alternate leaves similar to the basal leaves. They clasp the stem. The upper leaves are smaller, less lobed, less toothed, or entire. The leaf bases all taper at 2 points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terminal clusters of long-stemmed, yellow composite flowers with ray flowers only become white, spherical seed heads, smaller and more numerous than dandelions'.&lt;br /&gt;</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">Common sow thistle first appears in early spring as a basal rosette with roughly oval, hairless, bristly, stalked, deeply toothed, dull blue-green leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hollow stem, which appears in mid-spring, grows 1 to 6 feet tall, with very little branching below the flowers. The broad-based, triangular-lobed, stalkess, alternate leaves, up to 10 inches long and 2.5 inches across, are similar to the basal leaves, but they clasp the stem, and the two leaf base taper to a point. The upper leaves are less lobed and toothed, or entire. Older leaves turn grayish-green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long-stemmed composite flowers, blooming from early spring to late fall, cluster at the end of the stems. 0.25 to 0.75 inch wide, they consist of yellow strap-shaped ray flowers only. Present from mid-summer nearly to winter, the white, spherical seed heads resemble dandelions', only smaller and more numerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole plant, which arises from a taproot, exudes a white, milky sap when cut. </field>
      <field name="positiveId">•Basal rosette with roughly oval, hairless, bristly, stalked, deeply toothed, dull blue-green leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Hollow stem 1 to 6 feet tall, with very little branching below the flowers&lt;br /&gt;•Broad-based, triangular-lobed, stalkess, alternate stem leaves similar to the basal leaves&lt;br /&gt;•Stem leaves clasp the stem&lt;br /&gt;•Upper stem leaves are less lobed than lower ones, less toothed, or entire&lt;br /&gt;• Older leaves turn grayish-green&lt;br /&gt;•Leaf bases tapers to two points&lt;br /&gt;•Terminal clusters of long-stemmed, yellow composite flowers with ray flowers only&lt;br /&gt;•Persistent white, spherical seed heads smaller and more numerous than dandelions'&lt;br /&gt;•Long taproot&lt;br /&gt;•Whole plant exudes white, milky sap when injured</field>
      <field name="harvesting">Collect the smaller, youngest basal leaves when they first appear in early spring. They're the best-tasting. While you can certainly pluck off the leaves with your hands, cutting the root just under the center of the rosette with a pocketknife gets you the entire rosette in an instant, and while it's still intact, you can shake off most of the soil and debris before bagging the plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on in the spring, cut or tear off the youngest leaves and tender parts of the stem at the top. After cold weather in late fall, the stem leaves sometimes lose their bitterness, and you can strip these off too. Sometimes they leaves aren't bitter in the summer and early fall, but I haven't figured out how to predict when this will happen.</field>
      <field name="cooking">Raw common sow thistle tastes like lettuce. Cooked it's like Swiss chard. Add the leaves and tender young parts of the stems to salads, or sauté them with seasonings and cook them in a sauce, which dissipates the concentrated bitterness you'd expect when cooking shrinks the leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also add the leaves to soups, stews, casseroles, or other dishes that call for vegetables. They cook in 10 to 15 minutes. If the outer layer of the stem is tough, peel it beforehand.</field>
      <field name="nutrition">Common sow thistle provides vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, and C, as well as the minerals calcium, phosphorus, and iron.</field>

      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Don’t collect where people have polluted the soil with excessive nitrates, which can make you sick.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Other sow thistle species, which grow across North America, are as good as common sow thistle. Spiny-leafed sow-thistle *(S. asper)* has very spiny, glossy, dark green leaves with smaller lobes, and curly leaf bases that clasp the stem. You have to cut off its spines to eat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Field sow thistle *(S. arvensis),* which grows 2 to 5 feet tall, has weak spines, a long, creeping, perennial taproot, and dandelion-like leaves. It has hairy flower stalks, and hairy bracts under the flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other less closely related edibles also resemble common sow thistle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dandelions have yellow composite flowers and white, milky sap too, but they hug the ground, each flower stalk has only one flower, and the leaves have larger teeth.  Sow-thistles have more than one flower per flower stalk, there's a stem at some point during the life cycle, and the various species grow from 1 to 8 feet tall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wild lettuce has a row of hairs on the underside of the leaf’s midrib, and it lacks a taproot. Hairs sporadically spot chicory’s leaves, while common sow thistle’s bristly leaves lack hairs. Also, only common sow thistle’s older leaves turn grayish-green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sow thistle isn't a true thistle. True thistles, which include the edible bull thistle, have prickles that can really hurt, no white sap, and magenta flowers, not yellow ones.</field>

      <field name="nutrition">Catnip provides calcium, chromium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, silicon, and zinc.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">An infusion of the whole plant is used to help people sleep, and catnip contains the terpenoid nepetalactone, a mild sedative that gets about half the cats exposed to it high. Other constituents include alpha-humulene, beta-elemene, camphor, carvacrol, caryophyllene, citral, citronellal, geraniol, myrcene, piperitone, pulegone, rosmarinic acid, and thymol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Catnip's also a diaphoretic, and has been used to help fight colds and flu, as well as measles and other childhood diseases. It also helps calm an unsettled stomach, and has been used to alleviate colic, and for gas and diarrhea. It's been applied externally, as a compress, to black eyes, and used internally and externally for headaches. It's also been used to prevent miscarriage, although this hasn't been tested for safety or effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent mosquito repellent in the lab, the musty-smelling essential oil proved completely useless when I tested it in the field. The mosquitoes loved me as much as ever, and cats started following me around too!</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">Because it affects the uterus and hasn't been tested for safety in pregnancy, pregnant women are better off avoiding this herb.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">A cultivated relative with much smaller leaves that's also used for tea but doesn't grow wild in the US, *N. mussinii,* is also called catmint. Other fragrant mints *(Mentha spp.)* with opposite leaves and square stems don't have catnip's gray cast, leaves at right angles to those above and blow them, and the terminal the racemes with whorls of spotted, pale pink flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stinging nettles have opposite leaves that look a little like catnip's, but they're more narrow, and the plant doesn't branch. The racemes are axillary rather than terminal, they droop, and the nettle's hairs sting!</field>

      <field name="plantType"/>
      <field name="seasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="primarySeasonsEdible"/>
      <field name="season">Lesser celandine's leaves and tubers are good to eat when the leaves first appear at the end of winter and very beginning of spring, before it flowers, and the flower buds are good to eat soon after, also in early spring.</field>
      <field name="habitat">Bare, damp ground in low open woods, swamps, floodplains, and near rivers, as well as in wet meadows</field>
      <field name="range">Northeastern North America and the Pacific Northwest, but not northern New England</field>
      <field name="placeOfOrigin">Eurasia, Northern Africa, Western Asia, Caucasus, and Siberia </field>
      <field name="native"></field>
      <field name="howToSpot">Look for long-stalked, smooth-edged basal leaves carpeting wet, bare ground in early spring. A broken black stripe often runs from the leaf's base to tip. The solitary, long-stalked, yellow, buttercup-like flower, with 8 to 12 waxy petals, grows up to 1 inch across.</field>
      <field name="generalInfo">This very invasive spring ephemeral grows from 2 to 6 inches tall, carpeting forest and swamp floors with huge, dense stands. Its succulent, dark green, glossy, smooth-edged, kidney- to heart-shaped, long-stalked leaves grow 0.75 to 1.75 inches across—first basal, then alternate toward the bottom of the stem. A broken black stripe often runs from the leaf base to its tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blooming in early spring, the large, showy, yellow flowers, which grow up to 1 inch wide, look like buttercups with eight to 12 waxy petals. Each solitary flower grows on a tall, slender, delicate stem, towering above the alternate leaves, which are similar to the basal ones. After the petals fall off, a cluster of small, ovoid seeds replaces the flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small, whitish, finger-like tubers grow on the fibrous roots.</field>

      <field name="harvesting">Hold bunches of leaves down in one hand and cut off the stems with a pocketknife, or twist them off with your other hand.</field>
      <field name="cooking">The cooked young leaves, stems, tubers, and flower buds are edible, with a somewhat chewy texture. Unfortunately, they're not very flavorful. Chop the leaves and stemsand parboil them 2 minutes before adding them to soups, stews, rice dishes, or curries and cooking them another  ten to 15 minutes. You can include the tubers, which are too small to chop, or pickle them or the flower buds, which you also parboil before cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although non-poisonous raw, for some reason the leaves have an very unpleasant bitter aftertaste in this country, although not in their native range (in addition to first-hand experience here, I've queried other foragers in America and abroad to confirm this strange finding).</field>
      <field name="nutrition">The leaves are a good source of vitamin C.</field>
      <field name="medicinalUses">Lesser celandine contains lactones, triterpenoids, tannin, and possibly an acrid substance similar to anemonin. One of the constituents, protoanemonin, may have antibiotic properties, and its saponins may be fungicidal, but they need more testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, dried, powdered lesser celandine leaves are mixed with cold cream and applied to hemorrhoids, and to the perineum if torn during childbirth, as an astringent and possible antiseptic. Herbalists claim that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An infusion of the leaves is poured into bathwater for dermatitis and other skin irritations, i.e., rosacea, which usually involves a reddening of the skin of the face.</field>
      <field name="hasPoisonousLookalikes"></field>
      <field name="cautions">The plant becomes mildly toxic when it flowers and goes to seed, so use it when it's young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbalists advise pregnant and nursing women to avoid using this herb medicinally. Medicinal use may cause skin irritation or skin sensitivity to sunlight, and it may interfere with prescription medications, but there are no adverse reactions reported when it's used for food.</field>
      <field name="similarPlants">Marsh marigold, also edible boiled, looks similar, and this robust plant has glossy, rounded to kidney-shaped, long-stalked leaves, plus yellow, stalked flowers. However, it usually grows in water, and the leaves never have black stripes. It has five to nine deep yellow petal-like sepals, and it never creates dense stands that carpet the floors of forests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greater celandine *(Chelidonium magus)* also has yellow flowers, but this toxic member of the poppy family never creates mats, the flowers aren't waxy, they don't look like buttercups, and the plant simply doesn't look like lesser celandine—the greatest similarity is in their misleadingly similar names!</field>

      <field name="slug">5foraging-through-the-seasons</field>

      <field name="body">While I've provided you with the most accurate info possible about when plants are in season, seasons are relative. Early spring, for example, comes earlier or later in different years, and in different parts of the county, depending on how far north or south you are. That's why I've hedged my bets and avoided giving exact months: such info would often be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in NY, and while I've tried to describe the seasons of plants so they're accurate throughout the East (and much of the rest of the country), seasons will be different in different regions, so adjust your expectations accordingly if you live far north or south from me. And if you live where winters are puny, for example, expect to find cold-weather herbs, greens, and roots that are in season in early spring and late fall in colder regions to be available during the winter too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long-range climate change will alter the plants' seasons too. When I began foraging in 1982, plants began coming into season close to a month later at the start of the foraging season as they do as of this writing, in 2011. Fruits that depend on spring flowering time to ripen in autumn are also a month earlier, while cold-weather greens and roots remain in season a month longer, and, politically motivated climate change deniers not withstanding, the best available science projects that such trends will continue or even accelerate.</field>

Since botanists haven't strolled through every part of every state during all the seasons necessary to spot all the plants, and because climate change is shuffling the plants around, this info is approximate. When we add a a social networking component to a future version of this app, you can add to the science of plant distribution with your own observations, comments, and photos!</field>

      <field name="body">It seems as though removing plants from natural habitats would be environmentally destructive, but this &lt;i&gt;ain't necessarily so&lt;/i&gt;. Most, but not all wild foods are renewable resources. The faster you pick dandelions, Japanese knotweed, and garlic mustard, the faster they grow back. And mulberry trees aren't going to roll over and die no matter how many berries you eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, a few edible wild plants are rare in some locations. Those you should leave alone, or look for them where they're common, when harvesting would be more efficient anyway. If you collect small proportions of common plants where they're common, take only a small fraction, and, with the exception of common root vegetables, leave the roots in the soil to regenerate, so you'll be able to forage for these plants year after year. Using such common sense methods, I've had large groups of people foraging with me in the same places year after year for nearly 3 decades with no environmental impact whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real danger to wild plants is habitat destruction, so take whatever actions you can to support those who are protecting our planet. Indirectly, teaching kids to forage will promote a love of nature and the environment, and lead to more environmental protection in the future. I work with kids all the time, and it's amazing to see what they're capable of. Some of them have even grown up to become school teachers who bring their classes on my tours, and other teach their students about the environment in many other ways as well.&lt;br /&gt;</field>

      <field name="slug">91harvesting-wild-plants</field>

      <field name="body">This app will give you info on the most practical way to harvest plants most effectively. As a self-taught forager, I've learned from my mistakes, and I've made plenty. I've even poisoned myself, but that was before I became a forager: I grew up on junk food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foraging is also easier if you're prepared. Bring appropriate clothing—extra layers and a warm hat, warm socks and gloves if it's cold. Bring plenty of water (or ice water in an insulated container), special clothes that wick away sweat, and a broad-brimmed hat in hot weather. Don't forget a snack or lunch, and a navigation device (compass or GPS) in unfamiliar terrain. Bring plastic bags for veggies and herbs, containers for berries, and work gloves for thorny berries, nettles, and digging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small, sturdy shovel or trowel is much better than using a stick for roots, but beware of flimsy trowels, those with crimped blades instead of cylindrical shafts, commonly sold for soft garden soil, that break as soon as you try dig in wild soil.</field>

      <field name="title">92)Food Preparation</field>
      <field name="slug">92food-preparation</field>

      <field name="body">I've included the best ways of preparing the wild foods, some similar to what you'd do with commercial foods of the same type, some specific for the wild plants. You'll also get my recipes for all the plants I've had been able to collect in quantity. I suffer from a severe case of CCD (compulsive cooking disorder), and find myself continually drawn to the kitchen to experiment with whatever I've brought home. People think of foragers as survivalists, but I got into this field through my interests in food, cooking and science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm also a whole-foods vegan, and by some strange coincidence, so are all my recipes. Vegan and non-vegan tour participants who try them during my tours' lunch breaks always love them, and so will you, if you give them a chance. And just as you'd have to shop in a Japanese store or Mexican store to get unusual ingredients for cooking such cuisines, you may need to go to a health food store for some of the ingredients for vegan recipes. But they work, and the science I've studied has convinced me that they're good for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly don't want to push my ideas about health and nutrition down anyone's throats, but if you're interested in these concepts, check out my Wild Vegan Cookbook, available, signed on my site (please make any purchases there, so the book business doesn't get all your money), at http://www.wildmanstevebrill.com</field>

The only hitch is that the seeds don't exist! The plant spreads by its roots, and in 3 decades of foraging, I've never once seen the common reed set a single seed. There might have been a rare native species of &lt;i&gt;Phragmites&lt;/i&gt; from which one tribe of Native Americans could have [-supposedly] harvested seeds centuries ago, and this might have been noted by a 19th century writer and passed along in the unreliable foraging literature ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here's my final word of advice on the subject: If you're going to harvest the non-existent seeds, be sure to bring them home riding on your non-existent unicorn!</field>

        <field name="caption">These pears are much smaller than commercial pears but quite good at this stage, in late fall, when they become soft and sweet like pear sauce. You can tell they're soft because a few have already been squashed.</field>

      <field name="description">This low-growing, softly hairy European annual mint has opposite, rounded leaves with lobed margins, square stems, and attractive-looking pink to purple, two-sided flowers. Its musty smell reminds me of an accumulation of dust under the bed, and although people have eaten this plant without ill effects, I don't consider it food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It superficially resembles garlic mustard and stinging nettles, but unlike garlic mustard, henbit deadnettle has opposite, not alternate leaves, and red, square leafstalks and stems, quite different from garlic mustard, which smells like garlic when crushed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stinging nettles are covered with stinging hairs, and when you try to crush it, instead of detecting a musty odor, you get stung!</field>

        <field name="caption">At this stage, this awful smelling and tasting plant, with its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves, superficially looks like garlic mustard but the stem is square and red, unlike garlic mustard's rounder stem. Also, garlic mustard smells like garlic when you crush it.</field>

      <field name="slug">arrowhead</field>

      <field name="description">Also called wapatoo, duck potato, swan potato, and tule potato, this plant grows in the Mid-Atlantic states, the Midwest, and the Deep South. It's the same plant sold powdered as arrowroot and used as a culinary thickener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can cook the tubers of the wild plant, but it definitely ranks among the most difficult wild foods to harvest. You have to remove the tubers from the mud under lakes during root season, in late fall or early spring, when the water is ice-cold. It can be done, but I wasn't successful in loosening any tubers before the extremely cold water drove me back to dry land!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other similar &lt;i&gt;Sagittaria&lt;/i&gt; species are equally edible and just as difficult to harvest.</field>
