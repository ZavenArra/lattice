In the summer, look for nearly leafless stalks around 4 feet tall with showy, sky-blue composite flowers consisting of fringed ray flowers and no disk flowers.','This is a very common, widespread perennial, similar to the related dandelion when young, with basal leaves 3 to 10 inches long,  tastes like dandelions and commercial chicory (which is also a different species). The sky-blue composite flowers make it easy to spot when it dominates roadsides in the summer. The whole plant exudes a white, milky latex when cut.<br /><br />Chicory forms a basal rosette very early in the spring. The basal leaves begin lance-shaped, with small teeth, but the teeth soon become quite large, like dandelion\'s, although chicory\'s leaves\' teeth often point outward, not always toward the leaf\'s base, like dandelions\'. Chicory\'s leaf\'s midrib has some hair (dandelions\' don\'t), and usually some red color.<br /><br />A zigzag flower stalk 1.5 to 4 feet tall (sometimes taller) with tiny, barely noticeable, alternate, lance-shaped, stalkless, toothed leaves comes up in the summer (its woody skeleton persists through winter), bearing 15 to 20 showy, blue, stalked, composite flower heads with fringed ray flowers, but no disk flowers, and many stamens ending in the letter \"Y.\" The tiny, inconspicuous seeds that follow blow away in the wind.<br /><br />Chicory usually grows in dense stands.<br /><br />A deep, stiff, beige, perennial taproot usually grows much longer than a carrot\'s.','Collect the leaves of the smallest basal rosettes before the teeth get large and the leaves become too bitter to be palatable, in very early spring, or if new growth appears in late fall. Pass a sharp knife under the rosette to sever it from the taproot—much more efficient that picking off the leaves a few at a time.<br /><br />You can also dig up the root for making coffee any time of year with a shovel—much easier than using a trowel. Do so after it\'s rained, when the soil is more yielding, and choose a location that isn\'t rocky.','The leaves have a robust, dandelion-lettuce flavor, with a hint of bitterness that must be managed wisely. Use the leaves like dandelion leaves. Add the young leaves sparingly to salads or sandwiches. Too many may create too much bitterness.<br /><br />Or sauté them in olive (or other) oil with herbs and spices, then add a sauce consistent with a culinary tradition that uses the same spices (i.e., Mexican spices + salsa) and simmer. Leaves shrink when you sauté them, concentrating the bitterness, but this method nullifies the phenomenon. Adding the sautéed greens to soups or stews, i.e., one containing beans or noodles, also works well.<br /><br />The roots are usually too tough and woody to eat (although you can cook them, after which they\'ll taste like cooked wood!), but you can chop them, then roast them at 350 degrees for an hour, stirring occasionally, chop further to the size of coffee in a blender or coffee- or spice grinder, and brew into a well-known coffee substitute.','• Basal rosette of deeply toothed leaves with some of the teeth pointing outward<br />• White, milky sap wherever the plant is broken<br />• Often reddish midrib in the basal leaves<br />• Some fine hairs on the midrib<br />• Woody remnants of a flower stalk connected to many of the rosettes in early spring and fall<br />• Deep, stiff taproot<br />• Blue composite flowers with fringe-tipped rays mostly in the summer<br />• Zigzag, nearly bare flower stalk, up to 4 feet tall, with very small, alternate, toothed, lance-shaped leaves',NULL,'1. When they\'re very young, dandelion rosettes, also edible, resemble chicory rosettes, but dandelions\' basal leaves\' teeth always point to the leaf\'s base. Some of chicory\'s leaves\' teeth point outward. Chicory\'s basal leaves\' midribs are often tinged reddish, with some fine hairs, qualities dandelions lack. Many chicory rosettes have remnants of the previous year\'s woody flower stalks, which dandelions lack. When they flower, dandelions have familiar yellow flowers, while chicory grows a tall flower stalk with many blue flowers.<br />2. Young wild lettuce rosettes resemble chicory rosettes, but wild lettuce has fibrous roots, never a taproot, and it\'s midrib is triangular in cross-section. Later on, its flowers are yellow, like dandelions\'.<br />3. Commercial chicory, which doesn\'t grow wild in the US, is actually a different species, *Cichorium endivia,* also called curly endive.','The leaves are an excellent source of calcium, and they also provide some potassium, phosphorus, copper, zinc, magnesium, and vitamins A, K, C, E, plus some B-complex vitamins.','Like its relative, the dandelion, which has superseded it in modern herbal practice, a decoction of the root has been used for various liver problems, and to aid digestion.','','','','','',NULL,0,NULL,'',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4,15,'Burdock','*Arctium minus,* common burdock; and *A. lappa,* greater burdock','Family: *Asteraceae,* Aster family','','Taproot of 1st year plant: Spring, summer, and fall<br />Taproot of 2nd year plant: Spring, before the flower stalk appears<br />Flower stalk: mid-spring<br />Leave stalks of greater burdock: spring, summer, and fall','Burdock grows in the sun or partial shade, in disturbed soil, backyards, untended gardens, empty lots, overgrown fields, empty lots, meadows, edge habitats, and urban parks.','Burdock grows across most of North America and much of Canada, except in the deep south.','Look for the basal rosettes of large, coarse, wedge-shaped leaves, whitish underneath, the tall flower stalks bearing purple, shaving brush-shaped flowers, and the brown, prickly burrs.','This is a delicious root vegetable, prized in east Asia, with the bonus of an edible immature flower stalk, which is prized in Italy.<br /><br />Leaves: This coarse-looking biennial has huge, wedge-shaped leaves up to 2 feet long and 1 foot broad, forming a basal rosette the first year, and at the beginning of the second year. Unlike similar plants, the leaves are whitish and finely wooly underneath.<br /><br />Leaf stalks: The purplish-green leaf stalks can grow up to 1.5 feet long and .75 inch thick. Common burdock\'s leaf stalks are hollow, not furrowed. Greater burdock\'s leaf stalks are solid, with a groove along the upper surface.<br /><br />Taproot: The taproot, whitish after being scrubbed, consists of an outer rind and inner core, and can grow up to 4 feet long and 3 inches wide. It smells like potatoes and dirt. (After you scrub it, it smells like potatoes.)<br /><br />Flower stalk: The erect flower stalk, which arises from the center of the basal rosette in mid-spring of the second year, grows from 2 to 5 feet tall in common burdock and up to 9 feet tall in greater burdock.<br /><br />Flowers: Arising from green bases, the bristly, purple-pink, spherical, composite flowers, short-stemmed and 3/4 inch across in common burdock, long-stemmed and 1 to 1.5 inches across in greater burdock, resemble shaving brushes.<br /><br />Fruits: The ripe fruits, the inspiration for Velcro, consist of spherical burrs the size of the flowers, covered with tiny hooks. They stick to virtually anything they touch. Inside are many small, hard, curved, brown seeds.','Taproot: Burdock is a deep root that comes from Asia, and when you try to harvest it, you\'ll soon realize there\'s a hungry Asian person trying to pull it out from the opposite direction! There are 3 things you need to make this job relatively easy.<br />1. A shovel<br />2. A location where burdock is growing that\'s relatively free of rocks (not hard to do, since burdock is so common).<br />3. Moist soil, from a period where there\'s been plenty of rain, not a time when it hasn\'t rained for weeks, and the soil is rock hard.<br />Place the shovel an inch from the center of the rosette. Aim straight down, so you don\'t cut through the root. Grip the handle firmly with both hands. Repeatedly stomp on the shovel as hard as you can, to drive it all the way into the earth. Now, you can chance pushing upward with the shovel while gently pulling the leaves, and you may unearth the root, or most of the root, with no further effort. If it\'s unyielding, don\'t yank off the leaves, but remove the clod of soil with the shovel and repeat the process on the other side of the plant. When you\'re done, refill the hole with soil, so you\'ll create no environmental impact.<br />Flower Stalk: Cut the flower stalk with a pocket knife or pruning shears soon after it appears in mid-spring, while it\'s still very soft and flexible, long before the flowers appear.<br />Leaf Stalks: Cut them with a pocket knife any time, but only use greater burdock. There\'s not enough food in common burdock to make it worthwhile.','Taproot: The root tastes like a combination of potatoes and artichokes. Scrub the taproot with a metal scouring pad under running water to clean it. Slice diagonally, razor thin, or use the finest slicing blade of a food, so the root becomes tender more quickly. Do not discard the outer layer. It\'s just as good as the core. Digging up burdock takes some effort, so you\'re not going to want to throw out half your harvest for nothing!<br /><br />Burdock root is best simmered or steamed 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender, i.e., in soups, stews or casseroles. You can sauté it first if desired, but cooking it in liquid is also important to tenderize it. You can also bake it in a covered baking dish that includes liquid, so the hot steam tenderizes it.<br /><br />It\'s not poisonous raw, but it\'s probably hard to digest, and members of traditional cultures cooked it even in the days where going out to gather firewood could be dangerous.<br /><br />Flower stalk: Peel the fiber off the flower stalk (you may want to wear rubber gloves when you handle it, since it can stain your hands brown), slice, and pre-boil 1 minute to remove the bitterness. Cook it in any vegetable dish for 5 to 15 more minutes. It tastes like artichoke hearts.<br /><br />You can use greater burdock\'s leaf stalks the same way. Although there\'s way more food in the flower stalk, it\'s in season for only a short time.<br /><br />Leaves: The leaves are so bitter, if you squeeze one and touch your finger to your tongue, you\'ll wish you hadn\'t! Some people boil the very young leaves in multiple changes of water to get rid of the bitterness, but there are so many superior wild greens, you\'d make much better use of your time and effort learning them!','•Basal rosette of wedge-shaped, long-stalked, very large leaves (except when they\'re first emerging, in early spring) that are finely wooly and whitish underneath.<br />•Long taproot that\'s whitish when scrubbed, consisting of an outer rind and inner core.<br />•Flower stalk 2 to 9 feet tall with purple, shaving brush flowers giving way to ovate burrs bearing tiny hooks.','Cocklebur *(Xanthium spp.)* has burrs too, but they\'re arranged spirally, the rest of the plant doesn\'t look like burdock, you don\'t eat burdock when it has burrs, and I doubt anyone has ever been poisoned confusing the 2, but you should be aware of the possibility of confusion.','\"Dock\" means deduct or remove, and unrelated plants that people remove from their gardens, such as curly dock, a.k.a. yellow dock *(Rumex crispus)*, have the same confusing last name.<br />On the other hand, the unrelated bitter or broadleaf dock *(Rumex obtusifolia)* has large leaves that do resemble burdock\'s, and the plants sometimes grow side-by-side, but as a relative of yellow dock, bitter dock\'s hard, inedible taproot is bright yellow when scraped, and the leaves don\'t have burdock\'s white, wooly fuzz underneath. Although nonpoisonous, all parts of this plant usually taste so bad, eating them will make you wish you were dead!','Burdock root provides vitamins B6 and C, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, manganese, and sodium. It\'s an excellent source of inulin, a polysaccharide that doesn\'t elicit an insulin response, and is beneficial to people with blood sugar problems.<br />','A decoction made by boiling the root has been used for centuries in Europe and Asia as a blood purifier (detoxifier in modern parlance), and for the skin, liver, and kidneys. A poultice made by mixing the chopped leaves with clay and water, and bandaged to bruises, clears the them in a few days.

Unlike similar-looking rosettes, the leaves\' lobes point outward, and there\'s no white, milky sap.<br /><br />In mid-spring, long, slender, erect flower stalks, branching from the base, grow from 8 inches to 2.5 feet tall. Smaller, alternate, stalkless, lance-shaped or linear leaves, sometimes with tiny teeth, clasp the stems with 2 small, pointed lobes at their bases.<br /><br />The tiny, stalked flowers, growing inside 4 green, oval sepals, have 4 white petals which form a cross. They grow on loose terminal racemes. Maturing from the bottom up, the flowers metamorphosize into long-stalked, flattened, heart-shaped to triangular, 2-parted seed pods 0.25 inch long. The mature seeds inside are very tiny.','Sever the young rosette from the root with a pocket knife in early spring or fall, shake off the soil and debris, and bag.

While you can certainly grab handfuls of leaves, cutting the root just under the center of the rosette with a pocketknife gets you the entire rosette in a second, and while it\'s still intact, you can shake off most of the debris before bagging the plant. Use the leaves raw in salads or sandwiches, or cook 10 to 15 minutes along with more flavorful ingredients in any dish that calls for cooked vegetables.<br /><br />The flowers and tender tops of the stems taste like broccoli—great in salads but too small for cooked dishes, where their flavor would get lost.
